Since Sarah Palin is like herpes and will never quite go away, people in the media still seem interested in her and her famous word salads. For whatever reason (trolling?), the Washington Post recently asked the quitting snow grifter to write an op-ed piece on the significance of Hillary Clinton being picked as the first woman president should she win the Nov. 8 election. Palin was among a number of women invited to write pieces reflecting, in some personal way, on the meaning and significance of the election of the first woman as president. 
“Obviously, a Clinton victory is not assured,” cautioned Michael Larabee, the op-ed editor for the Washington Post . “But we’re hoping to gather the essays in advance so we can share them quickly if she is elected.” 
This is when the verbal diarrhea really hit the floor. She took her word salad game to new heights : 
Media mocks Trump’s “rigged election” warning to its own peril. 
More evidence in my inbox, this time from the Washington Post requesting I write an op-ed commemorating their coronation of Hillary – 10 days from now. This is hilarious! 
Good ol’ reliable WaPo – continuing its embarrassing fail that’s reminiscent of their forced correction after irresponsibly, absurdly claiming I joined Al Jazera; announcing to the world their goal was to not mention my name in print for an entire month (oh, what a blessed month that was!) and relentlessly suggesting my (and other Conservatives) irrelevancy in national discourse – assuming I’d participate in their in-the-tank shenanigans for the Globalists. 
No, Mr. WaPo Editor, can’t say I’m interested in writing for you. But I’d love a copy of your pre-printed post-election edition shipped to me in Alaska. Your bold “Clinton Defeats Trump” headline will be framed right next to another old rag we’re all familiar with… 
There has to be a statute of limitation on the victim card, which Sarah has been using for 8 years. Ever since she lost, it’s been one aggrevieved statement after another. Now she is doing double duty: Falsely claiming the Washington Post is “coronating” Hillary (they weren’t) and falsely claiming they are out to get her (they aren’t).

"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 23:00 UTC Authorities in North Dakota may be feeling the heat from the international attention the Dakota Access Pipeline is getting. They're now saying they lack the manpower to remove the encampment of protesters located on federal land near the controversial pipeline. The announcement may signal a softening of the treatment the protesters, up until now, have been receiving. For months now, The Free Thought Project 's spotlight has been shining on the, some might say, dark and dirty deeds of law enforcement and their treatment of largely Native American peaceful protesters. Attack dogs were unleashed on the protesters in September, injuring six, and an additional 30 protesters, including children, were sprayed with pepper spray. In all, more than 260 people have reportedly been arrested since the protests began in Morton County — over 100 this weekend alone. The sheriff's office's announcement comes just two days after The Free Thought Project encouraged readers to contact Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier's office demanding him to allow for peaceful protest, even providing a link to a petition for his removal. Spokeswoman Donnell Preskey told The Associated Press the department doesn't ""have the manpower"" to remove the more than 100 protesters from the property. ""We can't right now,"" she said. Preskey said the land belongs to a Texas-based firm, Energy Transfer Partners, and was purchased from a local rancher for an undisclosed price. According to the AP , the Native Americans claim the land is theirs by way of an, ""1851 treaty and they won't leave until the pipeline is stopped."" ""We never ceded this land,"" said protester Joye Braun. ""The $3.8 billion pipeline, most of which has been completed, crosses through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Opponents worry about potential effects on drinking water on the Standing Rock Sioux's reservation and farther downstream on the Missouri River, as well as destruction of cultural artifacts,"" writes the AP. The disputed ranch is more than 100 years old and was the first one to be inducted into the North Dakota Cowboy Hall of Fame. According to the AP: ""It is within a half-mile of a larger encampment on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' land where the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and hundreds of others have gathered in protest. Protesters do not have a federal permit to be on the corps' land, but the agency said it wouldn't evict them due to free speech reasons . Authorities have criticized that decision, saying the site has been a launching point for protests at construction sites in the area."" While the announcement by the Morton County Sheriff's office may signal a change in tone and the potential for more relaxed police tactics, it remains to be seen. Late Monday, Standing Rock Sioux chairman Dave Archambault II issued the following statement, calling on the Obama Administration's U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the militant treatment of its peaceful protesters, and asked for an injunction to the pipeline's construction. Archambault wrote; The militarization of local law enforcement and enlistment of multiple law enforcements agencies from neighboring states is needlessly escalating violence and unlawful arrests against peaceful protestors at Standing Rock. We do not condone reports of illegal actions, but believe the majority of peaceful protestors are reacting to strong-arm tactics and abuses by law enforcement. Thousands of water protectors have joined the Tribe in solidarity against DAPL, without incident or serious injury. Yet, North Dakota law enforcement have proceeded with a disproportionate response to their nonviolent exercise of their First Amendment rights, even going as far as labeling them rioters and calling their every action illegal. We are disappointed to see that our state and congressional delegations and Gov. Jack Dalrymple have failed to ensure the safety and rights of the citizens engaged in peaceful protests who were arrested on Saturday. Their lack of leadership and commitment to creating a dialogue towards a peaceful solution reflects not only the unjust historical narrative against Native Americans, but a dangerous trend in law enforcement tactics across America. For these reasons, we believe the situation at Standing Rock deserves the immediate and full attention of the U.S. Department of Justice. Furthermore, the DOJ should impose an injunction to all developments at the pipeline site to keep ALL citizens - law enforcement and protestors - safe. The DOJ should be enlisted and expected to investigate the overwhelming reports and videos demonstrating clear strong-arm tactics, abuses and unlawful arrests by law enforcement. The chairman's request seems to validate many of the reports coming from the field, that peaceful protesters are being labeled as rioters and are not being treated with the dignity they feel they deserve. As The Free Thought Project reported two days ago, many of the protesters are being thrown to the ground, squashed underfoot, strip-searched, and forced to remove sacred hair braids — all considered ""strong-arm tactics, abuses, and unlawful,"" by Archambault."

"Fitzgerald Griffin Foundation October 29, 2016 
[Classic: January 22, 1998] — Suddenly nobody is questioning Paula Jones’s veracity anymore. Mrs. Jones told a simple story and has stuck with it, while the president has shifted ground, equivocated with his patented “carefully worded denials,” and let his thuggish, blundering, and very expensive lawyer handle public relations. 
The Clinton team’s line, echoed by the major media until recently, has been that Mrs. Jones is “trailer-park trash” whose allegations are credible only to dirty-minded right-wing Clinton-haters. Never mind that her allegations are consistent with a great many other allegations from a great many sources. The Clinton strategy was to scare her off, and then, when that didn’t work, to make her character the issue, leaking their own allegations to the press. 
But her tenacity created enormous pressure, forcing the president to make a humiliating appearance in her presence a few days ago to give his deposition — and possibly to try to tamper with other witnesses. Only he knows how many other potential witnesses there are. 
The new charges of creepy lechery and criminality have finally cost Clinton his protective press. Though Newsweek spiked its own scoop, the story exploded anyway. All those journalists who have covered for Clinton now feel he’s yanked the rug out from under them once too often 
And it happened because a story they didn’t want to dignify with coverage refused to go away. The story Newsweek spiked was written by Michael Isikoff, who had left the Washington Post in fury two years ago when the paper spiked a similar story he’d written on the Jones suit. But now the “respectable” press has finally caught up with the “crazy” press, leaving Hillary Clinton to repeat her usual gripe — Bill’s just the victim of someone’s political agenda — to an empty gallery. 
Clinton is standing on a precipice, staring down into the abyss of impeachment and prison. One nudge — another story, witness, allegation, or tape recording — could push him over. And the market value of any damaging evidence has skyrocketed, with the media fighting fiercely for the kind of information they used to spurn. He’s at the mercy of any bimbo who wants to step forward. 
After being driven from office, Richard Nixon was able to make a comeback by claiming, however speciously, that his motive had always been to defend the dignity of the presidency. That’s a claim Clinton won’t be able to make. If he seduced a twenty-one-year-old White House intern and urged her to perjure herself for his sake, the dignity of the presidency was the last thing on his mind. Nor will he have the diehard it-didn’t-start-with-Watergate defenders Nixon had. In Clinton’s case, it started long ago in Arkansas. 
He arrived in Washington with a trail of sleazy rumors, some of them substantiated. The “respectable” press ignored all that, including the fact that Gennifer Flowers had enjoyed rapid promotion as a state employee (and had tapes of Clinton urging her to lie about their liaison). It ignored “right-wing” reports that he’d used state troopers to procure women. Such stories illustrated his readiness to abuse power for sleazy purposes, but they were treated as cheap sex gossip. When Paula Jones told her story, it fit the pattern — but was rejected as unworthy of serious attention. 
Now that the pattern is undeniable, Clinton is still Clintonizing — issuing new carefully-worded-denials, as if he might yet exculpate himself with verbal cleverness. It hasn’t sunk in that he no longer has many supporters who will seize on any excuse for believing his version. His guilt isn’t an epistemological puzzle. 
Supporting Clinton has become extremely costly. He has destroyed the Democrats’ congressional majorities in both houses, and though he managed to win reelection (by methods that will now get redoubled scrutiny), he has destroyed his own presidency. And his disgrace will be contagious. 
The major media should not be allowed to ask: “How were we supposed to know?” It’s their business to know — and to inform the public. But their job had to be done by Paula Jones and the “right-wing” press. ###

"UN spokesman depicted the human toll of the Mosul offensive: mass executions of those delaying ISIS convoys as well as human shields. Yoel Domb 
The UN Human Rights Commission described a number of the atrocities being perpetrated by ISIS operatives during the course of the Mosul offensive in the past week. For example, three women and three young girls were shot to death because one disabled girl could not maintain the pace of a group of villagers who had been evacuated from the place they were in by the terrorists. 
UN officials claim this is just one of a number of cases of civilian executions by ISIS in the past week. Civilians were also used as human shields against the attacks of the Iraqi army and the Kurds. 70 other dead civilians were discovered with gunshot wounds, as well as 50 policemen. 
In the village of Sapina, 45 kilometers south of Mosul, 15 civilians were shot dead and their bodies thrown into a river. Other

Surely, she can't be serious. No, this isn't a set-up to an Airplane! punchline, this appears to be life under an imminent Hillary Clinton regime. 
It turns out that Secretary of State is not really all about being the nation's chief diplomat and top foreign policy aide to the president, but is rather a cozy career path for Democratic politicians who want to pad their resumes. Who knew? 
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was an indisputable disaster. Leaving aside the clear violations with her private email server, which transmitted classified information , was potentially hacked , and put the nation's security at risk for Clinton's “ convenience ” here are a few more of her lowlights: 
Completely misjudging the Arab Spring “democratic” movement 
Gravely miscalculating with her “reset” policy and encouraging Russian aggression 
Assessing Bashar al-Assad as a “ reformer ,” overseeing a disastrous Syrian policy 
Failing to support the Iranian people during their freedom demonstration 
Pushing to remove Gaddafi by force in Libya, only to leave it a failed state 
Overseeing a Middle Eastern policy that culminated in the rise of ISIS 
Failing to secure the Benghazi, Libya annex that was overrun by terrorists, leading to the death of four American servicement, then lying by blaming a Youtube video Image Credit: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images 
It goes on and on. But it gets worse. The reigns at the State Department were turned over to Senator John Kerry, whose testimony on the Vietnam war is notorious on the right. Kerry's tenure has been nothing short of feckless and laughable. No, seriously. 
Vladimir Putin, for example, is actually laughing at Kerry's useless protestations against Russia's backing of Assad. Kerry was also a vocal supporter of the Iranian nuclear deal, and he is satisfied that the deal will keep the mullahs on good behavior, despite their venomous hatred of the United States and lengthy track record of lying. 
The icing on the cake for this stretch of Democratic career politicians taking over the helm at State will culminate with Hillary Clinton's whispered preference for the job with current Vice President Joe Biden. Image Credit: Mark Wilson/Getty Images 
As reported by The Washington Examiner: 
Vice President Joe Biden is at the top of the list for secretary of state if Hillary Clinton pulls out a win on Nov. 8. 
A source close to Clinton's transition team told Politico on Thursday evening that the Democratic nominee is already making serious considerations when it comes to who would be part of a Clinton 2.0 Cabinet. 
The hilarious part? Biden himself seems to be oblivious to the potential nod. 
Biden himself is apparently unfamiliar with the news. Neither Clinton, a former secretary of state herself, nor her aides, have informed the former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman that he's most likely to oversee international affairs if she wins. 
“He'd be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins,” said the source familiar with the transition planning. 
Though many are in disbelief about the report, there is one very plausible reason to believe that Biden very well could spend his sunset years at the State Department: And that's the reward for not running. https://t.co/10DepJ4x9B — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) October 28, 2016

"Blair Rollin: Nice quote from The China Study. I had forgotten about that. Thanks! vegPat 
“It’s the sunshine vitamin. Dr. McDougall, for example, does not recommend D supplements but rather fresh air and sunshine.” if you live in Florida or the tropics maybe and also not everyone can absorb vitamin D through this process so they may have a hard time getting there levels from the sun alone, its kind of like omega 3 from plant sources, yes its there but not readily available and some people cant’ absorb it efficiently, which is why you need a marine algae oil that can be easily absorbed Vege-tater 
I heard it said that if plants and trees can photosynthesize at your latitude, generally we should be able to get enough sunshine for our less intensive human needs, provided we make an effort to actually go outside and soak up the rays. I’m originally from CT and always wondered if part of the sickly and depressive effect of winter was our tendency to “hibernate” and not go outside until you had to. When my kids were little and I was outside all winter with them sledding and playing in the snow, it wasn’t a problem, until they were old enough to go themselves, and I hung back in the dry warmth! (Now I live in FL and stay inside all summer instead! lol) Ben 
Hi Blair. I am familiar with Dr. McDougall’s opinion. Living a bit north of him I am not confident we share the same levels of sunshine opportunity. As for B12, I have never washed my organic produce, and we grow a lot of our own veggies. Our soil is fabulous. The “sanitation” hypothesis has not worked for me. And it does not explain higher b12 levels in some people eating from these poor soils. So, it’s probably a little more complicated. And, considering the risks of not supplementing, only a fool wouldn’t get tested. Our family does supplement with B12 and it did work to correct our deficiencies. So, that’s an example where a singular nutrient did work out for the body. Many people also report success with vit D and dha supplementation. Dr. Gregor is an advocate of these practices. In my mind, he needs to have his crew tackle the conflict between on the one hand steering people away from vitamin supplementation and on the other advocating vitamin/nutrient supplementation. I assume he would say something like “Hey, if after switching over to the best diet on the planet, you discover you are lacking in some essential nutrients… rather than eat animal products (which historically have provided these nutrients to humans) because our environment is so toxic, the cruelty to the animals so extreme and the long term damage done to your body… find a good provider of the micronutrients from a wholesome source. Accept the world as imperfect.” vegPat 
there is no real inconsistency Dr Greger’s book lists it out How not to Die recommends the following supplements B12 (soil no longer has it, yes you can grow in healthy soil but average person needs to supplement it) Vitamin D (because a lot of people live in northern regions and darker skin blocks good conversion) Omega 3 algae oil (plants have omega 3 but is not readily absorbed and as you get older this gets worse) WFPBRunner 
Hi Ben If you watch some of the videos under the nutrients you list you will see that non-vegans are deficient also. For example my husband rides his bike out doors 3 hours per day, eats some meat and tested below 20 for Vit D. B-12 is just so important for obvious possible neurological issues. We could always drink swamp water though. Ben 
I agree. My question is about the necessity of supplementing. My question pertains to how are Dr. Greger’s recommendations to supplement (as outlined in his book) reconciled with a video like this one making the case that supplements do not work, and sometimes cause harm. WFPBRunner 
He is pretty specific. B12 is the big one. Vit D if you live too far North or work in an office all day. Omega 3 but I believe that was across the board. WFPB or not until we know differently for brain health. Blair Rollin 
These popups keep getting better and better. Vege-tater 
I find it so amusing to read the oppositional commentary about them! Maybe I’m just old and cranky but people seem to be getting more and more entitled, and think each video is for them exclusively. I just love what Dr. G. does, and that he does it at all, for US and our benefit, from his generosity and caring! You can never please everyone, so I hope he continues to let his light shine as he sees fit and let it sort itself out. Life is full of angst and seriousness, we need all the humor we can get! Ron Ninon 
It’s somewhat supercillious to “be amused” by all the people’s comments and efforts to express their discontent, such as I am doing now in an attempt to contribute positive constructive criticism,. The fact is, for many, the “light-hearted” new format has been stated as being downright distracting and works against the intention of the video which is, surely, to educate and inform, NOT to entertain or promote some kind of clever food comedy. The new format pop-up segments can also come across as sarcastic and aloof and so the video is not worth sharing with the many who are already skeptical as it will really put them off. Even fans on here are put off! If the efficiency of transmission of information is interrupted with completely irrelevant bells and whistles doing little other than exhibiting technical prowess with video editing skills and that causes distraction, memory interference and forgetting, and for some, irritation, then that is a fact that needs considered very carefully. A handfull have said they like the format but more have said they do not. An online vote might be useful. But I would question what it is that those who like the format like and whether they have absorbed the info as well as they would have without the memory interference. There are real cognitive mechanisms at work. Just my 2500 cents worth. guest 
I find some people’s repetitive complaints to be a needless distraction. The videos are prerecorded… after this, normal programming will resume. Ron Ninon 
Typical anonymous trollololololol. Ron Ninon 
You delete my response to this but let the guest’s sarcasm remain?? Just who is guest?! Thea 
Ron Ninon: I have previously directed you to the rules for posting on this site. If you read those rules, you would know that you may not call people names. To be very specific: You may not call someone a troll. I can tell who guest is and this person has made many quality comments on this site. Leave the moderating to the moderators. . Also, I have already warned you about your comments in general. Your opinion on this topic has been noted – multiple times over. No one else is going on and on and on about this topic. Enough already. The decision has been made to discontinue the popups after the current volume of videos has been released. Additional complaints from people who have already voiced their opinion take away from the main focus we should have here. Let it go please. Ron Ninon 
Your vendetta continues? First, Dr. Greger invited commentary. Until he himself posts a comment on this and his intentions, and his requests to stop commenting on it, then everyone, including me, has a right to comment on it. You have tried to intimidate me before (to see guidelines etc etc), and you continue to do so. You criticise me ALONE. I am NOT the only one who has criticized the format – and several others have repeated their sentiments across multiple posts on the topic but you do not slap them! This is social media and heavy-handed tactics by admin, although typical of facebook, should not be here. This is a more “professional” forum, at least I had thought. To that extent, your threats are unwelcome: you are targetting me and only me. I repeat, this is unfair! Your support of others who may disagree with me with your “votes up” of them belies a pack mentality – a popularity contest. This forum should not support such bias! I have made detailed and informed copmments. I work in the area of attention and perception…and distraction. Over 50% of drivers now text and drive – an epidemic of deadly distracted driving – many – half or more on this forum will do so while thinking they are just fine and so continue to do so. My point: I have knowledge on human attention. Nobody else has posted the reasons why they feel distracted by the videos. I have done so. If you don’t like my “info”, ignore it – it’s easy to do and easier than ignoring a pop-up! But to delete me or block me is a sad reflection of biased intolerance. I have done more for promoting Dr G’s videos than you will ever know or could ever comprehend. I am a supporter. I also use his info for personal health purposes. But I have a right to emphasize what (I think) needs emphasized (ie, no distractions, keep it professional, etc.). And we do NOT know what his new format, if it comes, will be. Will it also be controversial and problematic. Thus, repetition has value, provided it is not cut-and-paste, and my comments have not been repetitious in their content, if you bothered to read them carefully. I will continue to post if and when I feel it contributes. You must stop intimidating me. This is NF not FB. nc54 
But in this video the popup was not irrelevant. It gave an example of how to create food synergy. So you are wrong about this video. Ron Ninon 
“doing little other than…”. nc54, Fair comment, but…I still found it distracting as did some others who bothered to vote with a comment. Why do I need to watch a guy eating? Look, many will like it, many won’t. Would a vote help? The majority is not always correct! Guest 
Please stop the goofy dr greger popups….really distracts from the video content. I have enjoyed the videos and information for years, but really find the new popups jarring. Thea 
Guest: Have no fears. The large majority of the feedback for the popups has been negative. The NutritionFacts team listened to the feedback. The rest of the videos on this volume are already pre-recorded. But after that, the popups (whew!) will no longer be part of the video. 
What a coincidence…I just had blueberries and black beans for lunch! Don Bauer 
Any benefits to adding Maca powder to a smoothie? Vege-tater 
Every home I visit has rows and rows of supplements and vitamins lining their counters and cabinets, and of course they all eat the Standard American Diet, and know they are deficient, so think this is their saving grace! Heaven forbid a bit of real food sneaks into their diet, let alone a combination! It’s so scary what people consider food, and sadly, I was once one of them, so it’s really hard to shut my big mouth when I know what a HUGE difference it can make! WFPBRunner 
It’s sad right. They think it works. Wade Patton 
Okay, I lied. I cannot just quit the site because there are VERY few other sources I trust to keep abreast of new research and studies AND to do such in a non-commercial (i.e. believable) manner. 
I tried five times to listen to today’s “lecture”, but kept distracting myself. I hide the video behind other tabs now-of course I can still hear the “spots”. 
Now i have a solution. I’ll simply read transcripts. Thanks to those who transcribe. 
After seeing practically every single video Dr. G has made for NF.O and most of the other videos he has been in on Youtube, I don’t need any “extra” Dr. G in my videos. I liked the first 1,000 or 2,000 videos, but just can’t watch them any more. 
I hate that I cannot share the new videos. There are so many “nut jobs” out there selling ideas about foods and supplements and nutritional concepts that I fear Michael Greger would EASILY get lumped into that category if I shared the greenscreened videos. I had some hopes that I could help a few folks, friends, family, and others find a better way to eat, and was persistently pestering my FBF’s with video links from here with my own commentary, also some comments from here were shared in my short tenure as a WFPB eater. 
I’ll just cut and paste transcripts. I don’t want anyone thinking I’m “following a nut job”, rather that Dr. G is a real MD with real information that can REALLY help nearly everyone. I understand that many folks enjoy the cutesiness and such, but it cheapens the whole experience for me. I’m not a fan of gimmickery and distractions. As you were. Thea

"It has been 1,700 years since Emperor Constantine built the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where the tomb of Jesus was revealed. The emperor believed Joseph of Arimathea placed the body of Jesus inside the church, according to CBN News.
Workmen, under the watchful eye of The National Geographic, have gently removed the marble slab that laid on top of the tomb. This heavy piece of marble has laid on the tomb of Jesus since 1555 A.D. Fredrik Hiebert, a National Geographic archeologist-in-residence, said he was profoundly astonished by the find.
The Tomb of Jesus Hours of examination of the tomb of Jesus led the team of researchers to announce their revelations. Hiebert says, they are not 100 percent sure, but it appears the location of the tomb has not shifted. He also said that scientists and historians have wondered this for decades.
The tomb of Jesus revealed a layer of fill material. After hours of labor, workers exposed an entirely different marble slab with a cross carved into it. Workers also found, in the tomb of Jesus, three crosses and some iron nails. After high anticipation, of those watching, they finally uncovered what they believe is the original limestone burial bed of Christ .
Christian tradition states that the body of Jesus Christ laid on a shelf, or burial bed, carved into the side of a limestone cave. This happened after the Romans crucified him, around 30-33 A.D. According to Christian faith, Jesus was resurrected after his death. As the story goes, a woman who went to anoint Jesus’ body, three days after he was buried, said there were no remains in the tomb.
In the Gospel of John, 19:38-42, it is written that Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus, asked Pilate if he could take the body of Jesus away. He was given permission and took Jesus’ body.
Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes. He brought about 100 pounds of them. They both took the body of Jesus and bound him in linen covered in spices; this was a custom of the Jews. A garden grew in the place where he was crucified. The tomb sat in the garden no one had yet laid in. This is where John and Nicodemus placed the body of Jesus Christ.
Restoring the Tomb
Scientists from the National Technical University of Athens are trying to repair a structure that protects the tomb of Jesus called Edicule. This is from the Latin word, aedicule that means little house . The last dated work to the structure was between 1808-10.
In the 19th-century, Edicule suffered structural integrity, from an earthquake, in 1927. The building was shored up, in 1947, by the British authorities. Lack of financial resources and difficulties had put a stop to the repairs.
Antonia Moropoulou, the leader of the restoration project, said they will have to remove the marble and stone slabs. She went on to say they will also inject grout into them. This process will homogenize the complex structure.
People working on the project say that it is more than just a job. Vasyleyos Zafeylys, a Greek civil engineer, says he is a Christian Orthodox. He also said, he has worked on projects like this, but this is a special one. He believes he cannot go to another project that will be bigger and better than this one. Moropoulou said, it is a collaborative effort, but everyone near the archeological find feels the value of the holy tomb giving the resurrection message.
The churches’ communities agreed to restore the church, in March of 2016. Completion of Edicule is scheduled for spring of 2017. The $4 million-plus project has major backers such as royal benefactors from King Abdullah II of Jordan. Mica Ertegun gifted $1.3 million to the World Monument Fund in support of the endeavor.

"Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => 
A Syrian Kurdish and Arab force backed by US air strikes has launched an offensive against the Islamic State’s de facto Syrian capital at Raqqa aimed at maximising pressure on Isis when it is already under attack in Mosul in Iraq. Anti-Isis forces advanced six miles in the first four hours of the attack, capturing many villages and farms. 
The move against Raqqa, a city of 320,000 people on the Euphrates River, is by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) which numbers about 30,000 fighters, of whom 20,000 are seasoned Kurdish fighters and 10,000 are drawn from the Sunni Arab population of northern Syria. The US is keen not to provoke Turkey which has denounced the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) as terrorists. 
US officers say that one reason for seeking to isolate and capture Raqqa now is that it is at the centre of planning and execution of Isis terrorist operations against Europe, the US and the wider world and they fear such an operation is about to be launched. General Stephen Townsend, the US commander of Operation Inherent Resolve, which is aimed at eliminating Isis, said last week that “we know they’re up to something. And it’s an external plot; we don’t know exactly where; we don’t know exactly when.” He added that this uncertainty was creating “a sense of urgency.” 
It would be keeping with Isis’ actions in the past that it seeks to counter-balance setbacks on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria by staging spectacular terrorist atrocities abroad that show that it is still to be feared and can strike when and where it wants. It carried out two suicide bombings in Iraq on Sunday killing 25 people and wounding 50 in the cities of Tikrit and Samarra. 
The US-led war against the Caliphate declared after Isis captured Mosul in June 2014 has now reached a critical stage with Isis’s many enemies closing in on all sides. Iraqi troops, whose offensive against Mosul started on 17 October, are meeting strong resistance in the east of the city with one unit surrounded and cut off for a time when Isis fighters appeared behind it. 
The assault on Isis in both Syria and Iraq is very much orchestrated by the US and dependent on US-led airstrikes to destroy Isis positions. This may be more difficult to do as Iraqi army units move into Mosul which may have as many as 1.5 million people still in it. Some are seeking refuge behind the advancing government troops, but the numbers on the main road east of Mosul did not seem very large on Sunday, possibly because it is too dangerous for people to leave their houses and the Iraqi Army has told them to stay there. 
The opening of the Raqqa offensive brings with its political complications that may exceed the military difficulties because Turkey does not want Raqqa to fall to a force dominated by the YPG, which is the Syrian arm of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has been fighting a guerrilla war against the Turkey Army since 1984. The US has been trying to avoid an armed confrontation between the YPG and Turkey or Turkish backed forces, a possibility that has grown since Turkey had its local allies seize Jarabulus and a strip of territory along the Syrian-Turkish border in August. 
The mainly Kurdish SDF will be moving into a fertile area north of Raqqa where the population is Sunni Arab. There are doubts among the Syrian Kurds about suffering casualties trying to take an Arab city, which they cannot keep, when they would prefer to move west and link up their present swathe of territory with the Kurdish enclave at Afrin further west, but this is being resisted by Turkey. The Syrian Kurds are doing what the US wants because their future is very dependent on US military and political support. The SDF said it had received weapons from the US, including anti-tank missiles, and some 50 US advisers are reported to be accompanying the advance to call in airstrikes. 
The SDF spokesman Talal Sillo was quoted as saying that “we want to liberate the surrounding countryside, then encircle the city, then we will assault and liberate it,” he said. Asked about the possibility of intervention by Turkey or its local allies, he replied: “Of course, to begin the operation, we have made sure there will be no other forces but the SDF in the operation.” 
Underlining the complexity of the present situation, an SDF official, Rezan Hiddo, said Turkey has been an “obstacle” to the Raqqa campaign all along. He said that if Turkey moves against Kurdish areas in northern Syria then the Kurds would stop their campaign directed at Raqqa, adding: “we cannot extinguish the fire in our neighbours’ house if our home is burning.” 
Isis is using its traditional mixture of suicide car bombs, snipers, booby traps and Improvised Explosive Devices, but these no longer create the terror they once did. Counter-measures are more effective. Major General Maan al-Sadi told Iraqi state television that Isis fighters had launched more than 100 car bombs against his forces in east Mosul, which is only one of the fronts in the fighting. A Counter Terrorism unit came under attack from the rear after advancing into east Mosul, when Isis fighters emerged from houses behind them and isolated the convoy, preventing reinforcements from getting through. Surrounded and low on ammunition, they had to shelter in houses before they finally got out on Saturday. He Isis news agency Amaq released footage on Sunday of captured or destroyed military vehicles, including the burnt wreckage of a Humvee it said was taken in the eastern district of Mosul. Fighters shouted “Allahu Akbar (God is Greatest)” and unloaded ammunition and communications equipment. (Reprinted from The Independent by permission of author or representative)"

Former United States Department of State official Dr. Steve Pieczenik is a psychiatrist who has over 20 years experience in resolving international crises for four U.S. administrations.
Pieczenik was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger, Cyrus Vance, and James Baker. His expertise includes foreign policy, international crisis management, and psychological warfare. He served the presidential administrations of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the capacity of deputy assistant secretary.
He has come forward with a series of videos that expose the Clintons, explains that they co-opted many central facets of our government including the White House, the judiciary, the CIA, and the FBI. and claims that the corrupt couple belongs to a high-level pedophile ring.
Pieczenik explains that it was not the Russians who provided information to WikiLeaks – US intelligence offered the data to Julian Assange. This counter-coup is working against Hillary Clinton and her campaign.

Here, Pieczenik discusses the Clintons’ connections to Anthony Weiner , Jeffrey Esptein’s Lolita Express, and more.

In this video, Pieczenik reveals the details regarding Democratic Party ‘Fixer,” Jeff Rovin.

Dr. Pieczenik tells us “the second American revolution” is happening.

""The Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans,” hacking “American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions … in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election,” Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told Chris Wallace of Fox News in the third and final debate before the November election. 
But Wallace did not even ask about who hacked her e-mails, some of which have been made publicly available by WikiLeaks. Wallace asked Clinton about a private speech she had delivered to bankers in Brazil, in which she said she dreamed of “open borders” throughout the Western Hemisphere. But because Wallace had noted that the source was WikiLeaks, Clinton chose to discuss how the information had been obtained, rather than her shocking statement that she wants America’s borders to be open to any person in the Western Hemisphere who desires to come to the United States. 
Of course, that would most likely include the majority of the population of North and South America. Certainly it would be millions of immigrants, at the very least. 
Donald Trump countered Clinton’s bold claim that Russians hacked her e-mails, saying that she “has no idea whether it’s Russia, China, or anybody else.” 
In rebuttal, Clinton simply repeated her claim, and chastised Trump for even questioning the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials who have taken an oath to defend the country. 
Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the hacks were perpetrated by the Russian government, or at least that there was strong evidence for such. Should the Obama administration be announcing this to the general public? However, considering that the White House has demonstrated so little concern for the well-being of the United States, it is not surprising that Obama would opt to reveal this information less than a month before the election — an action designed to help the candidate of his political party. 
Of course, Clinton defended U.S. intelligence agencies as above politics. But the reality is that politics has clearly played a role in some decisions of intelligence agencies, such as in 2012, when the CIA interjected itself in the last political campaign by creating Benghazi talking points. And then there was the distortion of analysis on ISIS and Syria by SOUTHCOM — the U.S. Southern Command, responsible for all military activities in South America and Central America — which conformed to Obama’s foreign policy position. 
If the Russians were able to hack into Clinton’s e-mails when she was secretary of state, because she was so careless (at best) as to use a private e-mail server, then does that not offer a reason that she should have been indicted? 
Hillary did not tell the truth when she claimed that 17 intelligence agencies had determined the Russians were responsible for the hacking. Only two agencies — the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) — have even addressed this issue, and their conclusion is somewhat different from Hillary’s interpretation of it. The joint statement by DHS and DNI was that the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts, with the presumed intention to interfere with the election process in the United States. 
Certainly, the Russians have a history of interfering in the internal affairs of other nations — the KGB and other Soviet agencies regularly used disinformation to plant stories in the Western media. And, of course, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was a high-ranking KGB agent during the Cold War, has publicly stated that he would like to see the restoration of the Russian Empire of the Soviet Era. 
But all that does not prove Russia had anything to do with this specific hack. 
The accusation conforms with the narrative that the Clinton campaign has been spouting for the past few months: that Putin prefers Trump over Clinton. Perhaps. Perhaps not. Again, it is interesting that when it was clear that Soviet dictators preferred someone other than Ronald Reagan as president, the Democrats did not consider that a reason to vote for Reagan. Rather, they argued that the United States should “deal” with Brezhnev, Chernenko, Adropov, and Gorbachev, and were highly critical when Reagan did not do so in the early years of his presidency. 
Clinton herself vowed to have a “reset” on relations with Putin and Russia when she became secretary of state; however, relations have clearly deteriorated with Russia since she and Obama took over American foreign policy. 
Others do not buy the Russian-hacker theory, anyway. Willliam Binney, a former high-ranking intelligence officer with the National Security Agency, recently told radio host Aaron Klein that he believed it is more likely it was a “disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker” who is responsible. Binney even argued that the FBI has long had access to the database of the NSA, and because of that, “if the FBI really wanted [the e-mails of Clinton], they can go into that database and get them right now.” He insisted that the NSA has all of Clinton’s e-mails, including the deleted correspondence. 
Judge Andrew Napolitano, speaking on Fox Business’s Judge Napolitano's Chambers , challenged the Clinton assertions, declaring bluntly, “the Russians had nothing to do with it.” 
The entire discussion of the role of the Russians in passing the information on to WikiLeaks is a diversion from the startling statement Clinton made to Brazilian bankers: that she wants no borders in the Western Hemisphere. This means that it is highly likely that a President Hillary Clinton will follow the pattern of President Barack Obama, who has regularly ignored laws, such as those concerning immigration, with which he does not agree. 
So, the entire discussion of whether WikiLeaks obtained its information from the Russians or someone else is important, but if Hillary Clinton’s “dream” of a borderless Western Hemisphere were to come true, no one would have much motivation to hack into the e-mail of an American secretary of state. After all, how long could the United States continue to exist, in any meaningful way, without borders? Please review our Comment Policy before posting a comment

"Russia stops shipping Soyuz space rockets to France 28.10.2016 | Source: AP photo French newspaper Les Echos reported that Russia's state-run corporation Roscosmos will would not deliver Soyuz rockets to Arianespace of France. First off, Russia demands the receipt of the funds blocked in connection with the Yukos case. A statement from Roscosmos says that the Russian company will not work for free. ""No money - no products,"" Les Echos quoted a message from the corporation. It goes about 300 million euros, which Arianespace was supposed to pay to Roscosmos, but the funds were frozen by the Court of Arbitration in The Hague in the case of former Yukos shareholders . Previously, Roscosmos had won a case in France about the arrest of accounts of the state corporation in the Yukos case. ""They acknowledged that our arguments were correct, but we will continue defending our interests,"" director of communications at Roscosmos, Igor Burenkov said. On April 11, France arrested $700 million of Roskosmos and Space Communications money in connection with a judicial decision on the case of Yukos. Interestingly, NASA plans to purchase seats for its astronauts on board the Soyuz spaceship as Boeing and SpaceX seem to be unable to prepare their spaceships on time. US-based commercial companies Boeing and SpaceX are developing their own manned spacecraft - Starliner and Dragon. The deadline is near, so Houston has decided to consider a possibility to buy extra seats on board Russia's Soyuz. NASA hopes that at least one of the private spaceships will be able to perform operational tasks by the end of 2017 or early 2018. For the time being, one of the six necessary seats on the Soyuz spaceship costs the US nearly $82 million. By 2019, the price will increase.

"Britain looking forward to bonfire night because it can’t afford to put the heating on 05-11-16 
BRITAIN’S enthusiasm for firework displays is really about avoiding extortionate heating bills, it has been confirmed. 
Researchers discovered that, rather than being excited about synchronised explosions, most attendees are actually looking forward to getting the feeling back in their extremities without laying awake worrying about money. 
Zero-hours courier Sarah Smith, 33, said: “It’s not just the bonfire, there’s the body heat from the crowd too. What a treat.” 
Nurse Tom Logan, 27, added: “I couldn’t give a shit about fireworks. 
“I’d rather be at home watching Luther , but it’s so cold that I have to wear gloves and a hat inside. If getting warm means standing in the mud, in the dark, listening to people go ‘ooh’, that’s a small price to pay – and much better value than EDF.”

Hillary Clinton’s election night fireworks have reportedly been cancelled, after reports surfaced last week that she was already planning her victory celebration for Tuesday night.
A report from the New York Post claimed that law enforcement and fire department officials in New York City were being prepped for a “barge-launched pyrotechnic display off Manhattan’s Javits Center, where Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine will join their supporters for the Nov. 8 vote count.” The show was planned for 9:30 p.m. EDT, half an hour after the polls close.
While the Jacob K. Javits Center where Clinton is hosting the event has a symbolic glass ceiling , it is also important to note that the company she is reportedly using for the fireworks display is Garden State Fireworks. The same company produced the fireworks special for the grand opening of the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, NJ, in 2007.
Former Republican nominee Mitt Romney made similar plans in 2012. According to a report from the Daily Caller, the Romney campaign planned “an eight-minute, $25,000 fireworks show over Boston Harbor to celebrate a victory over Barack Obama that never happened.” 
Report of Clinton’s celebration drew criticism on Twitter, with some users resurrecting calls of a rigged election:
Oh, so #HillaryClinton already booked the fireworks? https://t.co/jiRSjKmclH

NYPD chief of intelligence Tommy Galati, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner James O’Neill held a press conference on Election Day security on Monday morning, where they revealed that the fireworks show has been cancelled.
“They do have a permit for fireworks, but at this point we believe the fireworks is canceled,” Galati said.
When asked what the reason was behind the cancellation, Galati said, “I cannot tell you that.”

"Remember the last debate when the internet blew up because Donald Trump said he wouldn’t necessarily accept the results of the election ? People were bemoaning him as a fascist and no one in the mainstream wanted to admit that our election process is entirely rigged . The trouble is, voter fraud on a grand scale can be tough to prove . 
As it turns out, voter fraud on a smaller scale has been detected in 6 locations already, according to today’s Drudge Report . But don’t worry. These are just “glitches” or “too few to make a difference.” 1) Chicago 
In the Windy City, the dead have been voting for decades. Two investigators have admitted finding proof of this, but they refuse to say that there is fraud. Relatives of the Voting Dead feel differently. They say that they’ve reported the deaths of their loved ones repeatedly, but that the names have not been removed from the rolls. But that isn’t the worst of it – not only are these people on the rolls – they’ve repeatedly voted since their deaths. 
Don’t worry, though. It’s just a few hundred dead voters that they’ve been able to confirm. No biggie. ( source ) 2) Philadelphia 
Chicago is not alone with the dead folks voting.There are also reports from Philadelphia that people are making their voices heard from beyond the grave. *cough* Local station Action News 6 investigated and found that a stunning number of people have been deemed “active voters” for many years since their deaths. 
Don’t worry, though. The local voting board says these mistakes are simply “human error” and that there aren’t enough dead voters to actually sway the election. ( source ) 3) Hollywood, Maryland 
A woman in Maryland has reported another incidence of “vote flipping.” She voted a straight Republican ticket, then checked after it was submitted. Her vote for Trump had been switched to a vote for Clinton. 
Don’t worry, though. The election officials there told her to just vote again. Of course, this would “undo” the vote for Clinton, but would it really count as a vote for Trump? I’m sure it’s fine. The election officials would want to be scrupulous about something like that. ( source ) 4) Miami-Dade County, Florida 
Two women have been charged with felony counts of tampering with the election. One, a temporary election worker, was caught marking ballots by her co-workers. The other was caught filling out voter registration paperwork for people who did not exist. 
Don’t worry, though. These were isolated incidents that have been dealt with. In the words of State Attorney Katherine Fernández Rundle, a Democrat, “Anyone who attempts to undermine the democratic process should recognize that there is an enforcement partnership between the elections department and our prosecution task force in place to thwart such efforts and arrest those involved. Now we need to move forward with the election.” ( source ) 5) Alexandria, Virginia 
A guy in Virginia who was formerly employed by the New Virginia Majority, an advocacy group aligned with the Democratic party, was caught using fake names to fill out voter registration applications. 
But don’t worry. Commonwealth Attorney Bryan Porter said, “Since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.” ( source ) 6) Lots of places in Texas 
Much like the report in Maryland, voters in various locations in Texas have reported that when they chose a straight Republican ticket, the voting machines opted for Clinton/Kaine instead of Trump/Pence . Voters in Amarillo, Arlington, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Cypress, Mesquite, and El Paso have all reported vote flipping from Trump to Clinton. 
But don’t worry. Election officials in the state say it’s not a problem with the equipment . It’s just those silly voters who don’t know how to use it. ““Typically, we’ve found it’s voter error with the equipment. Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates … or do something with the wheel….There is not an issue with the equipment.” ( source ) If you’re worried about election fraud… 
You can add a smartphone app by True the Vote called VoteStand to report incidents of fraud. Don’t let anything slide. If you are voting, make sure your choice is accurately recorded.

"Friday 18 November 2016 by Alex Webster Mannequin Challenge goes completely unnoticed at Southern Rail Workers who appeared to be frozen in time have aroused no curiosity whatsoever at Southern Rail HQ. Customer Service Manager Simon Williams, who always seems to be available at short notice, told our reporter, “Everyone in the department was stock still, and I wandered amount them filming with my smartphone. “I was amazed at their ability to remain totally motionless and unfocused on other stimuli. I even filmed the maintenance people outside, tools in hand, completely immobile. “After filming for a record-breaking twenty-five minutes, I realised I’d forgotten to actually send out the email telling people to prepare for the Mannequin Challenge. “I was the only person in the building doing any activity, even if it was just dicking around because of a YouTube craze. “I’ve never felt so alone; it was like waiting for something I knew wasn’t going to arrive, if you can imagine such a thing.” In the past few weeks, the Internet craze known as the Mannequin Challenge has hit offices and gyms across the UK. Participants must strike a pose in the manner of shop mannequins and then be filmed, giving the impression that a fleeting moment has somehow been captured on film. Why this is considered a challenge or even a good thing is still under debate. Mr Williams continued, “I’ve seen many videos of our passengers standing motionless on cold station platforms, but curiously that was before anyone had conceived of the Mannequin Challenge.

Donald Trump’s deplorable supporters aren’t waiting for the election results to start spilling blood. 
They’ve been threatening bloody violence ever since Trump began claiming that the election is “rigged” in favor of Hillary Clinton. And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. 
In Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of Trump’s stupid hats and a “Deplorables” T-shirt to vote. 
Election code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. 
Of course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules don’t apply to them. 
Well, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. 
At Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. 
But when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the volunteer’s hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. 
“It just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who’s probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other,” local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . “I think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they’re going to vote and so there’s nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.” 
Here’s the video via KTVT . 
Frankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. Trump’s supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as Election Day approaches. And if Trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. 
Clearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. But you won’t hear Donald Trump condemning this act of violence. After all, he is the one inciting it.

"Obamacare might work if you're getting a subsidy but it is killing the folks who have no subsidies or no employer who helps pay for costs but even they are getting hit hard. Part of the reason wages are stagnant is because wage increases have to go into health care increases.
Premiums would be rising faster without Obamacare? What I know is that friends who don't qualify for Obamacare have a $10,000 deductible and $1500 monthly premium. Some tell me their out-of-pocket costs have doubled. How does one budget for Obamacare?
And now Hillary wants to open up the exchanges to illegal aliens. Sure, we can pick up the tab for that, too."
"Anna Jaunger Correspondent, Inside Syria Media Center R ecently, the White House has repeatedly accused Syria and its allies of killing civilians in Aleppo, deliberate airstrikes at civilian infrastructure and so on. But it should be mentioned that usually these allegations are completely baseless. Ironically, in the midst of this immense uproar about the cruelty of the Syrian government and its Russian allies, Washington keeps carrying out notorious military ops resulting in casualties not among terrorists but mostly among civilians. 
On October 25, Amnesty International published a statement according to which in the space of two years at least 300 people were killed by the US-led coalition’s airstrikes. 
Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director at Amnesty International’s Beirut regional office, stated that analysis of available evidence suggests that in each of these cases, Coalition forces failed to take adequate precautions to minimize harm to civilians and damage to civilian targets. 
Despite the fact that AI bases its assessments on the data received from Syrian human rights organizations, local monitoring organizations and satellite images and footage, an AI expert, Neil Sammonds, claimed that it was just statistics, and that there might be many more casualties. 
Although John Kerry commented on the report, the US isn’t accustomed to recognizing its “mistakes”. For instance, the airstrike e.g. bloodbath, conducted by the US-led coalition against government troops in Deir Ezzor in mid-September. After numerous excuses and denials, Washington eventually claimed then that it was a mistake. This “mistake” looked rather suspicious as ISIS militants started their offensive towards the Syrian army position immediately after the airstrikes. M oreover, Lieutenant General Stephen J. Townsend, the commander of Operation Inherent Resolve, has admitted that due to the Command’s strategic mistakes by Iraq’s troops and their US-backed allies they still haven’t been able to surround and block Mosul. Unfortunately, these “accidental” lapses allow the terrorists to freely leave the city and penetrate Syria. Of course, this development entails the creation of new flashpoints in the country, with further endangerment of the lives of civilians.
It bears repeating that in Mosul the US-led coalition is doing the same things that Washington now is trying to blame Damascus and its allies for. Only in the last three days, the coalition airstrikes have killed 60 civilians. Just since October 21, US warplanes conducted an airstrike against a school in the south of Mosul, and the next day attacked residential neighborhoods in the east of the city, and on October 23, air strikes destroyed a house of civilians in northern Mosul. 
Thus, it is clear that the United States, while claiming it is fiercely fighting terrorists in the Middle East, a claim heavily disseminated throughout its corporate media, it is in actuality doing the opposite, while preparing more devious mayhem and endless chaos in these tormented nations.

"Media skeptic 'America Has Lost' in the Philippines as Duterte Calls for Alliance with Russia and China 
'Maybe I will also go to Russia and talk to Putin, and tell him there are three of us against the world - China, Philippines, and Russia'   Strategic Culture Foundation 
«Your honors, in this venue I announce my separation from the United States… both in military and economics also». 
Thus Philippines President Rodrigo «The Punisher» Duterte unleashed a geopolitical earthquake encompassing Eurasia and reverberating all across the Pacific Ocean. 
And talk about choosing his venue with aplomb; right in the heart of the Rising Dragon, no less. 
Capping his state visit to Beijing, Duterte then coined the mantra – pregnant with overtones - that will keep ringing all across the global South; «America has lost». 
And if that was not enough, he announced a new alliance – Philippines, China and Russia – is about to emerge; «there are three of us against the world». 
Predictably, the Beltway establishment in the «indispensable nation» went bananas, reacting as «puzzled» or in outright anger, dispersing the usual expletives on the «crude populist», «unhinged leader» . 
The bottom line is that it takes a lot of balls for the leader of a poor, developing country, in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, to openly defy the hyperpower. Yet what Duterte is gaming at is pure realpolitik; if he prevails, he will be able to deftly play the US against China to the benefit of Filipino interests. 
«The springtime of our relationship» 
It did start with a bang; during Duterte’s China visit, Manila inked no less than $13 billion in deals with Beijing – from trade and investment to drug control, maritime security and infrastructure. 
Beijing pulled out all stops to make Duterte feel welcomed. 
President Xi Jinping suggested Manila and Beijing should «temporarily put aside» the intractable South China Sea disputes and learn from the «political wisdom» of history – as in give space to diplomatic talks. After all, the two peoples were «blood-linked brothers». 
Duterte replied in kind; «Even as we arrive in Beijing close to winter, this is the springtime of our relationship,» he told Xi at the Great Hall of the People. 
China is already the Philippines’ second-largest trade partner, behind Japan, the US and Singapore. Filipino exports to these three are at roughly 42.7 percent of the total, compared to 22.1 to China / Hong Kong. Imports from China are roughly 16.1 percent of the total. Even as trade with China is bound to rise, what really matters for Duterte is massive Chinese infrastructure investment. 
What this will mean in practice is indeed ground-breaking; the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will definitely be involved in Philippine economic development; Manila will be more involved in promoting smooth China-ASEAN relations in all sorts of regional issues (it takes the rotating chair of ASEAN in 2017); and the Philippines will be more integrated in the New Silk Roads, a.k.a. One Belt, One Road (OBOR). 
Three strikes; no wonder the US is out. And there’s even a fourth strike, embedded in Duterte’s promise that 
he will soon end military cooperation with the US, despite the opposition of part of the Filipino armed forces. 
Watch the First Island Chain 
The build-up had already been dramatic enough. On the eve of his meeting with Xi, talking to members of the Filipino community in Beijing, Duterte said, «it’s time to say goodbye» to the US; «I will not ask but if they (the Chinese) offer and if they’ll ask me, do you need this aid? [I will say] Of course, we are very poor». 
Then the clincher; «I will not go to America anymore … We will just be insulted there». 
The US was the colonial power in the Philippines from 1899 to 1942. Hollywood permeates the collective unconscious. English is the lingua franca – side by side with tagalog. But the tentacles of Uncle Sam’s «protection» racket are not exactly welcomed. Two of the largest components of the US Empire of Bases were located for decades in the Philippines; Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. 
Clark, occupying 230 square miles, with 15,000 people, was busy to death during the Vietnam War – the main hub for men and hardware in and out of Saigon. Then it turned into one of those Pentagon «forward operating» HQs. Subic, occupying 260 square miles, was as busy as Clark. It was the forward operating base for the US 7th Fleet. 
Already in 1987, before the end of the Cold War, the RAND corporation was alarmed by the loss of both bases; that would be «devastating for regional security». Devastating» in the – mythical - sense of «defending the interests of ASEAN» and the «security of the sea-lanes». 
Translation; the Pentagon and the US Navy would lose a key instrument of pressure over ASEAN, as protecting the «security of the sea-lanes» was always the key justification for those bases. 
And lose they eventually did; Clark was closed down in November 1991, and Subic in November 199 
It took years for China to sense an opening – and profit from it; after all during the 1990s and the early 2000s, the absolute priority was breakneck speed internal development. But then Beijing did the math; no more US bases opened untold vistas as far as the First Island Chain is concerned. 
The First Island Chain is a product, over millennia, of the fabulous tectonic forces of the Ring of Fire; a chain of islands running from southern Japan in the north to Borneo in the south. For Beijing, they work as a sort of shield for the Chinese eastern seaboard; if this chain is secure, Asia is secure. 
For all practical purposes, Beijing considers the First Island Chain as a non-negotiable Western Pacific demarcation zone – ideally with no foreign (as in US) interference. The South China Sea – which in parts is characterized by Manila as the Western Philippine Sea - is inside the First Island Chain. So to really secure the First Island Chain, the South China Sea must be free of foreign interference. 
And here we are plunged at the heart of arguably the key 21st century hotspot in Asian geopolitics – the main reason for the Obama administration’s pivot to Asia. 
The US Navy so far counted on the Philippines to oppose the proverbial, hyped up «Chinese aggression» in the South China and East China seas. The neocon/neoliberalcon industrial-military complex fury against «unhinged» Duterte’s game-changer is that containing China and ruling over the First Island Chain has been at the core of US naval strategy since the beginning of the Cold War. 
Beijing, meanwhile, will have all the time needed to polish its strategic environment. This has nothing to do with «freedom of navigation» and protecting sea-lanes; everyone needs South China Sea cross-trade. It’s all about China - perhaps within the next ten years - being able to deny «access» to the US Navy in the South China Sea and inside the First Island Chain. 
Duterte’s game-changing «America has lost» is just a new salvo in arguably the key 21st century geopolitical thriller. A Supreme Court justice in Manila, for instance, has warned Duterte that, were he to give up sovereignty over the Scarborough Shoal, he could be impeached. That won’t happen; Duterte wants loads of Chinese trade and investment, not abdicate from sovereignty. He’d rather be ready to confront being demonized by the hyperpower as much as the late Hugo Chavez was in his heyday."
"Putin calls for observing military safety measures to avoid incidents October 28, 2016 TASS vladimir putin , dmitry peskov Russian President Vladimir Putin. Source: Kremlin.ru 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for strictly obeying set safety measures to avoid dangerous incidents involving military aircraft and ships, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Oct. 28. 
""Unconditionally, the president does not support fanning any tensions,"" Peskov stated. ""He urges strict observance of the existing regulations in international law, which define cooperation in the context of avoiding dangerous incidents - both in the skies and at sea."" 
Along with this, Peskov neither confirmed, nor denied media reports that at one of the meetings, Putin had allegedly harshly responded to an incident when Russian jets flew close to a U.S. warship. 
""Closed-door meetings are held so that opinions could be exchanged there freely,"" the spokesman emphasized."
"  Donald Trump Is The Candidate For Americans, Not Special Interests Donald Trump Is The Candidate For Americans, Not Special Interests Luke Stranahan 
Luke Stranahan is an engineer by trade and an armed patriot by inclination. He writes for Return of Kings as a leisure pursuit and an attempt to do his part to help reverse the slide into moral decrepitude of modern society. Follow him on Twitter. November 2, 2016 Politics 
Next Tuesday is the American election, and, for better or for worse, we’ll pick the next President at that time (assuming we don’t get mired in voter fraud and recounts), and we’ll either brace for government mandated SJW enemas or bask in a temporary setback of those evil people. But, today, I want to talk on Trump once to match an article from last week, and I intend to focus on how he is the American candidate, as opposed to the special interest groups’ one. 
I had a conversation last week with some people who acted as SJWs, but were later presented by a mutual friend as libertarian. The discussion immediately went nasty, with my opposition painting Trump (and anyone who supported him) as a racist and a bigot. Upon trying to determine why two of the left’s ubiquitous labels were applied to me this time, I learned that their perspective was, unless you were universally for all special interest groups, you were a bigot or a racist. False Dichotomy And The American Nightmare 
The problem, I found out, was that these people have distilled the political spectrum down into a black or white situation. Either you want all refugees here from the Middle East, all the Hispanics from any country south of the border to come here freely and citizenship for those already here, and that any black people shot by police are just misunderstood and were turning their lives around, or you’re a racist. There’s simply no middle ground. 
They don’t understand that Trump is not a special interest candidate, by which I mean that he is not going to put any minority group ahead of the rest of us at our expense, but he is not racist towards minorities, or sexist towards women. 
It is possible to be against illegal immigration, but treat Americans of Hispanic ancestry as valued citizens whom you will represent. It is possible to be against feminism, Affirmative Action, and the persecution of men for the profit of women, yet still value American women as Americans themselves. It is possible to note that some black people cause a disproportionate amount of crime, yet note that some police are racist, and see that there are bad and good cops AND bad and good black people. 
The American Dream is that all men are created equal, and that’s men as in humanity, not just males. It is not that all men are equal, and there’s a big difference to note here. You have the same opportunities as everyone else when you are born with the exception of disability, and I do not know anyone, myself included, that is against governmental aid for the disabled. 
What we have, instead, is the American Nightmare, where the left uses government and taxes for the most inane of causes, trying to fix any disadvantaged group’s lot, real or imagined, so that things will be better. They take from the producers, and give to the non-producers so that, according to their idealistic vision, they will suddenly become productive members of society (or become addicted to the welfare tit and vote Democrat for the rest of their lives.) The Good Of The Country Over That Of The Individual 
Long gone are responsible Democrats like Kennedy who told us to ask what you can do for your country. Every recent Democratic President, from Carter to Obama, and most of the Democrat Congressmen, view the working middle class of the country as simply a group to exploit for their pet special interest groups. Trump is the first candidate in a long time who isn’t for the blacks, or the gays, or the Muslims, or the feminists, or whatever, and that matters a lot. 
The reason why not being for a special interest group (which is ALL that Hillary is for, with her youth vote, black vote, women’s vote, gay vote, etc.) is so important is that these groups, even put together, do not matter when it comes down to the good of the country. Don’t get me wrong, there’s plenty of good, hardworking black people, just like there’s the same for women, and for gays, and for young people, but these hardworking folks from all these groups aren’t going to be part of the BLM, or La Raza, or Lamda, because they’re too busy being productive Americans. Activism is for unemployed people. 
What’s going to happen if we don’t placate BLM and just ignore them? They riot a bit more and some get arrested? What if we told them that people that commit crimes to protest being treated like they commit a lot of crimes is ass-backwards thinking and counter-productive to their goals? They’d quit rioting. 
What would happen if we shut the Mexican border down to illegal immigration, but made a straightforward, but strict, path to citizenship for Hispanics that wanted to be citizens? What if we said, this is America, we appreciate your culture and encourage to preserve it and your language in your children, but the national language IS English, and all business and schooling will be done in it, and in it only, and it’s your choice to not learn it, but the difficulties that will arise from that choice are all on you? They’d be Americans, proud of their heritage and their legal immigration and citizenship as well. 
What would happen if we told gay people that it’s cool if they have civil unions under the law, and have the same rights as everyone else, but it’s not cool trying to pick a fight with a Christian bakery to make the government hall monitor come drive them out of business just because their belief in their God and that you’re sinning makes you uneasy and worried that they might actually be right? 
What if we told them it’s ok to do whatever you want with another consenting adult, but you don’t have to try to make five-year-olds decide if they’re gay or straight when they shouldn’t be wondering about that till puberty hits? They’d be normal Americans who just happen to like sex with the same gender, and they’d quit pushing their agenda and being obnoxious and in the rest of our faces. 
What would happen if we talked to Muslims and said that there is a huge, deafening, silence when it comes to the subject of Islamic Terrorism from them that makes it hard to trust any of them? What if we told them that we needed their help to bring the religion out of its tacit acceptance and support of terrorism, and part of that help means supporting us vetting Muslims coming here more strictly until they are no longer statistically more likely to be terrorists than people of other religions and ethnicities? They’d go along with that and maybe realize we’re fixing a problem, not hating a people. 
What would happen if we told women that feminism has all but killed modern marriage due to universal punishment of divorced men and that no punishment for false-rape accusers both makes men not trust women and insults any real rape survivor? What would happen if we told them that giving them jobs for their genitalia over their skills is destroying industries by lowering the only standard that matters, that of merit; that of excellence? 
What if we told them that gender ratios and quotas may fix the macro view of sexism, but make the man passed over for the position solely because you were female pissed as all hell towards women and, when you do that to the majority of men, you’ll be just as successful, and just as hated by men as men were and were hated by you in years past? They’d realize that it’s not a competition, it’s a cooperation, and maybe skill should be valued over sex. 
What would happen if we stopped all these divisive issues that really don’t do anything other than tear us apart and work on a better economy, on rights for all, on border security? What would happen if we simply looked at each other as Americans, and put us, all of us, first? What would happen if we ripped out the crap in the Federal government that overtaxes people, or deploys armed forces against our own countrymen? What would happen if we made the Supreme Court Constitutional again, and made term limits a reality for Congress? Maybe we could get a government for, by, and of the people again. Maybe America can indeed by great again like the man says. Conclusion 
I’m not in a special interest group. No President, outside of George W. Bush right after the September 11th attacks, that I can recall since my childhood, has been for me as an American. I’ve always been someone to be taxed, to be disarmed, to be hated, to be blamed. It’s not racism or bigotry to want us all to be treated as equals and not be penalized for real and imagined wrongs that occurred in the past before I was born, or more recently yet with which I had nothing to do. 
I’m not part of the problem. I’m an American; the people who say I am part of the problem are the problem. Their candidate, mired in scandal, corruption, and treason, is Hillary Clinton. Mine, with a message of hope for the country, not just some groups in it, is Donald Trump."

I felt what this world needs at this time, Unity beyond race, concern for one another, and togetherness. I felt peace and calm. Then when the police came I felt the opposite, I felt lies, setups, and oppression, but I'm trying not to dwell on the negative. My only wishes with this video is that it helps in some way. Wasn't sure how to help so I just started filming. Much love to everyone on the front lines!! Much love Standing Rock, Oceti Sakowin, Turtle Island, all Indigenous Nations overseas, all spiritual leaders, and all beautiful Human Beings of all colors (Black, Red, White, Yellow, Pink, and Orange haha! jk). You are all important and I love you all equally! When I was at camp I got the feeling that this is the beginning of something new, something that excited me and woke me up, learning a new way to fight injustice, something bigger than what I thought it was, and it's beautiful. The energy, courage, and unity I felt at camp is inspirational. To EVERYONE at home let's keep spreading truth for those on the front lines! If anyone seeing this goes to Standing Rock, I would encourage you to be humble, sit by the microphone where they talk and feed, and listen to the leadership teach good things. It's a beautiful happening, don't go to lead, go to help... Peace love and prayers to all including the police, sheriff, gov, and ETP, maybe they will have a change of heart.

Rapper Kanye West has come out in support of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, drawing boos and whistles from fans. 
Kanye West has always been something of a provocateur and a nihilist, and is staunchly anti-political correctness. 
Last night he stirred a maybe unprecedented level of controversy, however, declaring at a Saint Pablo Tour show in San Jose: “I would have voted on Trump”. West told the audience at a concert in San Jose, California on Thursday night that he didn’t vote in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential elections “but if I would have voted, I would have voted for Trump.” 
“This is my platform and I’m going to talk about the paradigm shift that’s happening right now,” he said at the top of a 40-minute political speech that came at the cost of several songs. 
It’s hard to ascertain exactly the point he was trying to make as we only have tweets and videos from attendees, not a transcript, to go off, but it sounds as though he was mostly praising the disruptive nature of Trump’s campaign, which ‘inspired racists to reveal themselves’. “I would’ve voted for Trump”– @kanyewest pic.twitter.com/XtyUteCgUZ 
— albertoreyes (@albertoreyes) November 18, 2016 

“Whether you voted for Hillary or Trump, this is a safe space for both of you,” he told the audience, asking any Trump voters to make themselves known. He also reiterated his desire to run for president in 2020, saying his focus would be on education and that his campaign would use a different political model. 
“Stop focusing on racism,” he added, declaring sombrely: “We are in a racist country – period.” His stance stands in stark contrast to 2005 Kanye, who famously declared that “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” in the wake of the devestating Hurricane Katrina. 
The concert received an understandably mixed response. 
Kanye was apparently happy when one woman screamed that she loved him in spite of his appreciation of Trump’s campaign, but there was also a lot of booing, stunned silence and even a few projectiles – one of which was a Yeezy shoe, which Kanye promptly signed and returned to the thrower.

21st Century Wire says… 
Mexico’s billionaire tycoon Carlos Slim saw a large chuck of his wealth evaporate – literally overnight, after news of a Donald Trump election victory hit the currency and stock markets on Wednesday morning. 
According to Bloomberg financial analysts, Slim, Mexico’s wealthiest person and rated fifth on the global rich list, took a stinging $5.1 billion haircut after the Mexican Peso went into a 12% free fall after Trump’s stunning upset over Democratic Hillary Clinton. 
Slim’s loss amounted to a staggering 9.2 percent of his total fortune. 
In the week before, polls showed Hillary Clinton as the odds on favorite, netting the billionaires a staggering $57 billion in total wealth increase across world markets. However, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, oligarchs lost a total of $41 billion during Wednesday’s epic slide – with Slim being the biggest loser. "

"Reprinted from Spectator.org . 
Tom Hayden, the Vietnam War protester and SDS founder, died this past weekend at age 76. 
Hayden’s journey was in many ways tragic. Born December 1939 in the Detroit suburbs, he was not, unlike many radical leaders, a red-diaper baby. His parents were Irish Catholics who named him after St. Thomas Aquinas and sent him to Catholic school. His father was a Marine who worked for Chrysler, and an abusive drunk. Hayden’s parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy, which affected him terribly. Hayden’s friend and ex-radical, David Horowitz, observed that Hayden harbored what Irving Howe once described as an “obscure personal rage,” possibly from his estrangement from his father. “Tom was indeed an angry man,” wrote Horowitz, “who seemed in perpetual search of enemies.” 
Hayden channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to America, and was the antithesis of anything that Thomas Aquinas would have ever imagined: SDS, Students for a Democratic Society. 
Hayden will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many Americans, the snarling activist who married “Hanoi Jane” Fonda and literally wrote the script for SDS. Hayden wrote SDS’s manifesto, its founding Port Huron Statement, which Hayden’s cream-puff obituary in the Washington Post generously referred to as “an expansive utopian manifesto that extolled ‘participatory democracy’ as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the Eisenhower decade.” 
Right. 
Hayden’s odd expressions of “participatory democracy” included another writing he scribbled: an infamous June 4, 1968 letter wishing “Good fortune!” and “Victory!” to the North Vietnamese colonels who were killing American boys in Southeast Asia — using the same kind of artillery that Hayden’s sweetheart Jane posed beside in her stint as a Viet Cong cover-girl. That was just one of countless disturbing actions by Tom Hayden at the time, all of which today’s leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and (of course) “social justice.” 
But not etched in our memory was what might have been Tom Hayden’s swan song long after his and his wife’s cheerleading for the Viet Cong: namely, the document that he wrote for our President of Fundamental Transformation. Few know this, but Hayden was a founder of another group of destructive forces, a group called Progressives for Obama. 
The group’s members came together in 2008, coalescing around the only Democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was far-left enough for them to support. They constituted a Who’s Who of the ’60s SDS crowd. Among the nearly 100 formal “signers” to Progressives for Obama were Mark Rudd, Carl Davidson, Jane Fonda, Thorne Dreyer, Daniel Ellsberg, Richard Flacks, John McAuliff, Jay Schaffner, and more. Columbia University was naturally well-represented, if not through the likes of Rudd, who shut down the campus in 1968, then through current faculty such as Todd Gitlin, a former SDS president who today is professor of journalism, sociology, and chair of Columbia’s doctoral program in communications. 
Whereas the likes of Obama friends Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn were thrust into the national spotlight in 2008 by conservatives like Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, Progressives for Obama flew under the radar, largely unnoticed even by the right. 
Appropriately, spearheading Progressives for Obama was the man who had spearheaded SDS. Tom Hayden was one of the four “initiators” of Progressives for Obama, along with Barbara Ehrenreich, Bill Fletcher, Jr., and Danny Glover. 
It is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of Progressives for Obama resembled the roster of SDS-ers called to testify before Congress in December 1969 for their subversive activities. Aside from the likes of Hayden, Rudd, and Davidson, other SDS-ers among Progressives for Obama were Bob Pardun, who was SDS education secretary from 1966-67, and Paul Buhle, a professor who has recently sought to revive SDS. 
Among these names from the insane ’60s, all were fired up in 2008 over the unique opportunity that a fellow far-left radical, one Barack Obama, offered. They saw Obama as a golden chance, a once-in-a-lifetime moment, and they got it on November 4, 2008. Obama won the day, and they at last won the day, too. 
And therein, among the Progressives for Obama, the testimony of leader Tom Hayden was especially revealing. 
Understand that after his early life establishing SDS, meeting with and expressing “Good fortune!” and “Victory!” to the Viet Cong, and vigorously protesting the American system, Hayden went into politics, professional activism, and education. Like his erstwhile SDS brethren, Hayden grasped the power of higher education (which they have pervaded), and served as a professor at Pitzer College and also at Obama’s alma mater, Occidental College. 
Like Mark Rudd, like Bill Ayers, like Bernardine Dohrn (all of them now in higher education), Hayden had come to view a quick “revolution” of the system as too daunting, if not impossible. He had become much more patient, instead advocating a “progressive” evolution of slower, measured change . By 2008, he was seeking to advance the “progressive” cause within the established, mainstream Democratic Party. 
Of course, Hayden once helped blow up the Democratic Party’s national convention in 1968. No matter: the party of 2008 was different and warmly accepted him. 
Hayden was ecstatic over Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. He jumped in with both feet, looking to assist wherever he could, with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining America in Vietnam. Not one to tinker around, Hayden got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement, as he had done for SDS — once again there at the creation. The man who drafted SDS’s pivotal Port Huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for Progressives for Obama. 
During the 2008 campaign, a touched Hayden was moved to verse over the emergence of Obama. In one article, titled, “Obama and the Open and Unexpected Future,” written for CommonDreams.org, self-described as a website for “Breaking News & Views for the Progressive Community,” Hayden mused: 
I didn’t see him coming. When I read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president, I was at least sentient enough to be interested. When I read Dreams of My Father [sic], I was taken aback by its depth. This young man apparently gave his first public speech, against South African apartheid, at an Occidental College rally organized by Students for Economic Democracy, the student branch of the Campaign for Economic Democracy which I chaired in 1979-82. The buds of curiosity quickened. 
Hayden saw in Obama a long-awaited vehicle for “economic democracy,” an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth — “economic justice,” or “redistributive change,” as Obama himself had once put it. Hayden wished that, “Win or lose, the Obama movement will shape progressive politics… for a generation to come.” He also hoped that that progressive movement likewise “might transform” Obama as well. Both could reinforce and shape one another. 
Hayden wrote that in June 2008. When Obama was elected later the following November, Hayden was beside himself with joy, surely shocked that the American electorate had finally voted for a president that Tom Hayden saw as his kind of president. Once upon a time, traditional Democrats like Hayden’s parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what Tom and his pals did to their party’s convention in Chicago in 1968, at what they did during the Days of Rage the next year, at what they did at Columbia during the student strike, and on and on. But now, by 2008, the Democratic Party was theirs. It belonged to the ’60s kiddies. 
The former SDS founder became particularly vocal in his praise for Obama once the election was over. During the election, the goal was to organize, raise money, but not speak too loudly, out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional Democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills, who joined unions, who “clinged” to their God and guns, who prayed rosaries and filled churches, who were pro-life and anti-gay marriage. With the presidency now secured, Hayden could open up. Joined by his former comrades at the take-no-prisoners website of Progressives for Obama, he began regularly sounding off against Obama’s critics — those opposing “single payer” or the “public option” in “healthcare reform,” or government “management” of General Motors — with the subtlety of a howitzer. 
With the presidency won, Hayden and his allies were free to express themselves, to demonize health-insurance companies, the financial-services industry, AIG, the Big Three automakers, or whatever other capitalist “reptile” (Lenin’s phrase) stood in the way of President Obama’s desire for “reform” and mandate for “change.” 
In the two-term presidency of fundamental transformation under Obama, Hayden and friends achieved many of their common dreams. 
By this election cycle, in 2016, Tom Hayden must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the Democratic Party. 
Alas, it was fitting that Tom Hayden became seriously ill (his final stand) during a turn for the worse at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this past summer, where he was striving to ensure that the Democratic Party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via SDS and the Weather Underground. That path, in the hands of Hillary Clinton, is assured. 
Today, at long last, for Tom Hayden and friends, the new Democratic Party and the new America is theirs. He can rest in peace, assured that his mission is finally being accomplished."

“I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,” then-New York Senator Clinton told the Jewish Press, a New York-based weekly newspaper, several months after the January election. 
“And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win,” she said. 
Until Friday, the comment Clinton made on September 5, 2006, only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist Eli Chomsky. An editor and a staff writer for the Jewish Press, he interviewed Clinton at the newspaper’s office in Brooklyn. 
Chomsky, who shared and played the tape for the Observer, says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with Clinton, during which the Palestinian parliamentary election was among primary topics. The comments have been posted on SoundCloud. 
Speaking to the news portal, he recalled being confused by the fact that “anyone could support the idea — offered by a national political leader, no less — that the US should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.” 2006 audio emerges of Clinton proposing election rigging in Palestine; censored by Israeli press for past 10 years https://t.co/LsMYcUzJR4 
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 28, 2016 
The interview took place nine months after the Hamas movement claimed 76 of the 132 parliamentary seats, pushing aside the US-favored Fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet. That victory was neither welcomed in Israel, nor in the US. In Washington, where Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a Palestinian Authority that included Hamas. 
Then-President George W. Bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the “power of democracy,” but refused to deal with Hamas as long as it opposed Israel’s existence and espoused violence. 
That day in September 2006, Clinton made “odd and controversial comments,” all now saved on the 45-minute record that Chomsky “held onto all these years.” 
“I went to my bosses at the time,” Chomsky told the Observer. “The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody — even a direct quote from anyone — in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn’t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.” Don't forget to follow the D.C. Clothesline on Facebook and Twitter.

"Shock!!!! Hasn't this been in the news for years??? Businesses were finding that Chinese chips had built in vulnerabilities allowing Chinese intelligence easy access???
Why is there a big surprise??
Obama and the Libs have dropped the US's drawers and presented a willing posterior for the Chinese, (who Soros favors most, and Obama second after Shiia Theocracies)."
"Oakland's Honor Band Kneels in Protest of Police Violence Oakland's Honor Band Kneels in Protest of Police Violence By 0 43 
A group of middle and high school students in Oakland, California, recently made international news when they joined San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s silent protest against racism and police violence in the United States. The students, members of the Oakland Unified School District’s Honour Band, knelt as they played the national anthem before a professional baseball game. 
The year 7 and 8 students spoke to Red Flag about their decision to “take the knee.” Inspired by Kaepernick, high school members of the district’s school band first proposed the idea. Right away, the middle schoolers knew that it would be controversial. From their first day of school, US children are taught to show extreme reverence for the national flag during the anthem. This includes standing with hats off and hands on their hearts. Anything else is seen as highly disrespectful. 
Despite this, some of the students felt so passionately about the need to take a stand against recent police killings that they still wanted to do it. 
One student, Mikayla, 14, delivered an impassioned speech to the others about the need to stand up against racism. “I wanted us to kneel because as a country we need to have a conversation about what is going on here,” she said, explaining why she felt so strongly. “We have been turning our backs on murder and racism, and I was tired of not doing anything about it.” 
Before the game, band conductor Zack Pitt-Smith made it clear the decision to kneel would be each student’s choice. Even as they took the field, no-one was sure who was going to do it. 
Serena, 14, remembers, “I was scared to kneel because I wasn’t sure if anyone else would join me. I was thinking, ‘Should I kneel? I feel very strongly about this — I’m going to do it.’ But I was still shaking because I didn’t know what everyone else would do.” 
Nearly all of the 155 band members knelt as they played. Everyone had their own reasons. “I’m learning about human rights in history class, and the number…"
"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 09:10 UTC A new large study presented at the American Neurological Association Annual Meeting has found a strong connection between cholesterol-lowering medications and Parkinson's disease. Contradicting previous claims that statins are protective against PD. In recent years there has been a considerable effort to try to find new applications for statins. Reports have tried to link statins with positive results on a wide range of conditions, such as: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis and Depression. These claims have been somewhat surprising considering that the brain and nervous system have the highest requirements for cholesterol and low cholesterol levels are associated with cognition problems, increased suicide, and an increased risk for some types of cancer . Many people have suspected that the data is being carefully cherry picked in an attempt to show a false benefit and expand the use of statins into other areas. In the new study, researchers analysed data from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database - including information on 30,343,035 persons aged 40 to 65 years. The use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of Parkinson's disease. This is not the first time that we have seen an absence of the predicted benefits of statins in real life data. For example, a large study in 2011 collected data from 289 of 290 municipalities in Sweden and found that the predicted benefits of statins had not materialised, despite a dramatic increase in statin use. An important finding of this new study is that all of the cholesterol lowering drugs included were associated with an increased risk of PD. Suggesting that the harms of the drugs could be directly related to the cholesterol-lowering effect. This adds to the mountain of data that now exists to show that having a low level of cholesterol is worse than having a high level. Sources Nilsson, S et al. No connection between the level of exposition to statins in the population and the incidence/ mortality of acute myocardial infarction: An ecological study based on Sweden's municipalities.

CNN report s that protesters from around the world continue to congregate in North Dakota in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux and their struggle to stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline through (or placed so as to negatively affect) tribal lands. 
The issues and the divide between sides seem to be fairly conventional: Promises of jobs and economic growth motivate the pipeline's supporters. Its opponents cite environmental concerns (especially the prospective damage to tribal lands) and allege violations of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 in Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners' wheedling of land use permissions out of federal and state governments. 
On balance, the opponents seem to have a good case; the supporters not much of a case at all. 
For more than a century and a half the US government has selectively ignored its treaties with the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes whenever those treaties threaten to stymie the plans of corporations with friends in government. Successfully holding Washington to its word this time might give the politicians and their cronies pause next time. 
And even if letting the US government use treaties as toilet paper just because it can wasn't an incredibly corrosive idea, keep in mind that it's not just the Sioux who are getting mugged. Private land owners all along the pipeline's 1,100 mile route are feeling the pain, too. Like Keystone XL before it, ETP leverages government's power of ""eminent domain"" -- under the pretense that the pipeline is some kind of public service rather than the private for-profit enterprise it actually is -- to steal much of the land required to complete Dakota Access. 
The go-to excuse among proponents of these ""public/private partnership"" type land thefts is always ""jobs and economic development,"" but even if that excuse flew (it doesn't), it's a pretty poor one in this case. The $3.7 billion pipeline is advertised as creating a whopping 40 permanent jobs. I'm not sure how many people work at the average Wal-Mart, but it looks like more than 40 to me. How many jobs in agriculture and other sectors would Dakota Access destroy along the way? We have no way of knowing. - Advertisement - 
For me, the bottom line is this: If the only way to do something you want to do involves stealing other people's stuff, you shouldn't do it. And you certainly shouldn't get government help to do it. Dakota Access is the opposite of the American way. - Advertisement -"
"Many Popular Tea Bags Contain Alarming Amounts of Deadly Pesticides (avoid these brands like the plague) Most conventional tea brands such as Lipton, Allegro, Celestial Seasonings, Tazo, Teavana, Bigelow, Republic of Tea, Twinings, Yogi, Tea Forte, Mighty Leaf, Trader Joe’s, Tetley contain really high levels of toxic substances such as fluoride and pesticides. We are not talking about calcium fluoride which is a natural element, but about the synthetic fluoride which is a toxic by product. These levels are dangerously high to the point of being considered unsafe. So drinking cheap tea can be as bad as eating junk food. Cheap Tea Contains Fluoride and Pesticides 
Most teas are not washed before being dried, thus non-organic teas contain pesticide residues. Some tea brands ( even those claimed organic or pesticide free! ) have recently been found to contain pesticides that are known carcinogens – in quantities above the US and EU limits! 
A new study published in the journal of, Food Research International , found that cheaper blends contain enough fluoride to put people under the risk of many illnesses such as bone tooth, kidney problems and even cancer. 
In fact, some brands of cheap tea contain nearly 7 parts per million (ppm) and the allowed level of fluoride is 4 ppm. This is quite scary since fluoride gets into your bones and accumulates in your body. It stays there for years. So how did fluoride get into tea? 
The tea plant accumulates fluoride as it grows. This means that old leaves contain the most fluoride. Cheaper quality teas are often made from old leaves that contain more fluoride than young tea leaves (here is an example) . Additionally, these cheaper brands use smaller leaves which contain more fluoride. 
And what about decaffeinated tea? 
Well, decaffeinated tea showed higher fluoride levels than caffeinated tea. 
So what is the solution? Should you stop drinking tea all together? Of course not! First of all, make sure to buy loose leaf tea and brew your tea from scratch. Bagged tea which might seem convenient and ready to go, is often made from low quality leaves which surely contain more fluoride. Stick to white tea (here) . It has the least amount of fluoride. Buy organic tea because the methods for cultivation are more sophisticated and conscious. They might even use purified water for the soil. We’ve just scratched the surface here, please check out Food Babe’s full report for more detailed information and a chart of which teas came out with their reputations intact – and please share with your tea-loving friends!"
"Bel Marra Health October 31, 2016 
Here’s a snapshot of America’s health when it comes to the heart: Heart disease is the number one killer. High blood pressure is a contributing cause of about 1,000 deaths a day – and one in every three American adults has the condition. About seven in 10 don’t realize it, putting them at risk for heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease. 
About seven in 10 adults with high blood pressure use medication to control it. 
That’s according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
While we’re not quibbling with the necessity for medication to get blood pressure under control, there are natural remedies for high blood pressure, including spices and herbs that can help. Since keeping your blood pressure in the healthy range is something you need to do all your life, it’s better to control it without drugs, if you can. 
Natural home remedies for high blood pressure 
You’ve likely heard a lot about lifestyle factors that can have a huge impact on your blood pressure, like stress, alcohol, lack of exercise, smoking, and diet. The most important of these, in our books, is a heart-healthy diet. Focus on watching your salt intake (and balancing it with more potassium from foods like bananas, lima beans, melons, and squash), limit your sugar, and cut down on caffeine. 
As part of your heart-healthy diet, consider the following spices and medicinal herbs to lower high blood pressure. You can incorporate them into your cooking, baking, and meal prep – as a little extra something to help your heart. They’re nature’s way of providing us with the good things we need to stay healthy. 
Medicinal herbs and spices to lower blood pressure quickly 
Basil: This is good news for cooks and foodies. Versatile, fragrant basil for lowering blood pressure is a great addition to many culinary favorites. Tear some fresh basil leaves and sprinkle liberally on your next pizza or bruschetta, use for a Thai curry, or try it chopped and beaten into softened butter and melted over roast chicken or crushed boiled new potatoes. 
Try keeping a small of the herb in your kitchen garden (for easy, fresh access) and then it’s even more convenient to add to your cooking on a regular basis. 
Tasty, yes, and good for helping to lower your blood pressure. The U.S. National Library of Medicine reports that extract of basil has been shown to lower blood pressure, although only briefly. But that’s a start to get you on track. It may work in a similar way to medication by affecting levels of endothelins, which are proteins that constrict blood vessels. When blood vessels are constricted, blood flow is slowed down or partially blocked – not good! 
You need good blood flow for circulation and overall health. Your body depends on the nutrients and oxygen in your blood to be carried efficiently through your veins and arteries. 
Garlic: Another kitchen staple and one of the top natural remedies for supporting healthy blood flow, this pungent seasoning brings wonderful flavor to foods. Add it fresh to your dishes, like soups, stews, and stir-fries. 
If it’s a little on the strong side for your preference, roast it first in the oven. Trim the end off the bulb and drizzle a bit of olive oil over each exposed clove. Then cover with aluminum foil and bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 30 to 35 minutes. Try spreading this deliciousness on party toasts at your next gathering. 
Not only addictive and good to eat, garlic can help with healthy blood flow (good for your heart and blood pressure). 
Cardamom: This seasoning comes from India (think fragrant chai tea) and is often used in traditional dishes of South Asia. It has a sweet flavor similar to grapefruit and ginger, if you can imagine that. Scientists in India have studied its effects on blood pressure, and recommend a teaspoon of cardamom powder taken with honey twice a day for healthy blood pressure. 
Other options? Include cardamom seeds or powder in soups and stews, spice rubs, and in baked goods for a kick and a positive health benefit. 
Cat’s claw: When it comes to medicinal herbs to lower high blood pressure, cat’s claw has been used in China for thousands of years. Studies have suggested its effectiveness. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), rhynchophylline, an alkaloid or certain organic compound in cat’s claw, has demonstrated an ability inhibiting both the formation of plaque on arterial walls and formation of blood clots in the brain, heart, and arteries. 
You’ll find cat’s claw in supplement form in health stores and supplement sections at your supermarket. 
Celery seed: Another herb popular in traditional Chinese medicine, celery seed has been used to help with hypertension. You can use the seeds to flavor soups, casseroles, and other savory dishes – and you can also juice the whole plant. It has a salty taste, making it a good mix with the sweeter fruit juices. Try carrot, apple, and celery first thing in the morning for a terrific pick-me-up. It’s a nutrient powerhouse in a glass. You might like it better than your morning coffee (we said might!). 
Celery in your diet can act as a natural diuretic, so its potassium and sodium content helps to regulate body fluids. It also has a nutrient called phthalide, reported to promote cardiovascular health. 
These are a few medicinal herbs to lower high blood pressure. As you can see, going the natural route is an appetizing one. So start with your diet, and spend more time in your kitchen preparing fresh, whole foods and sampling these heart-healthy herbs and spices. Tags:"

“America’s strategic and economic interests in the Mideast and Muslim world are being threatened by the agony in Palestine, which inevitably invites terrorist attacks against US citizens and property.” 
Eric Margolis Sun Media Sept 2 2001 (nine days before the Sept 11 attacks against New York and Washington DC.) 
As Americans enter the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on their nation, they still have not understood the true cause of these dreadful attacks. 
Who can blame them? Our politicians and media have totally obscured the truth behind these and subsequent attacks that we call ‘terrorism.’ While we mourn 9/11, US B-52 heavy bombers are raining bombs on what’s left of Afghanistan in a futile attempt to crush tribal forces (aka Taliban) fighting western occupation. 
We did the same thing in Laos in the 1980’s, as President Barack Obama properly noted during his visit there last week. Laos has never recovered and Afghanistan won’t either. 
Since 2015, the US has dropped at least 32,000 – 1,000-2,000 lb. bombs on Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan and Afghanistan – all Muslim nations. US bomb inventories are running critically low as arms makers work overtime. 
9/11 was a revenge attack conducted by mostly Saudi nationals who claimed they wanted to punish the United States for supporting Israeli oppression of Palestine, and for what they claimed was the US ‘occupation’ of Saudi Arabia. 
That’s as much as we really know. We have never gotten the full story about 9/11. The best we can do is ask “qui bono,” who really benefitted from the attacks? 
The 9/11 narrative was immediately twisted by President George Bush into a spurious claim that America had been attacked by Muslims because of its ‘freedoms’ and her ‘way of life.’ This deceit opened the Pandora’s box from which issued the rising wave of Islamophobia and Crusading fever sweeping over the US and Europe. 
America was attacked for what it had been doing all over the Muslim world, not for what it was. Most Americans don’t know that the first CIA ‘regime change’ in the Mideast occurred in Syria, way back in 1948. We’re still at it today. 
Ever since, the US, Britain and France – the imperial three musketeers – have been breaking and making regimes across the Mideast and Africa, and installing vicious dictators to do our bidding, earning enemies from West Africa to Tajikistan. 
Hillary Clinton said this week that if elected president she would advance ‘American exceptionalism’ and assure the new world order. These are code terms for imperialism and hegemony. If Clinton wins, look forward to foreign and military policy directed by Goldman Sachs and the neoconservatives. 
Donald Trump vows a major increase military spending at a time when America’s infrastructure is rusting or collapsing and its debt soaring. Both Trump and Clinton warn of growing security threats to America from ISIS and North Korea. In reality, the greatest internal threat is the type of Saturday night gang shoot-outs in Chicago that have killed 500 people so far this year. 
ISIS is a military pipsqueak – a bunch of 20-something hooligans. North Korea only wants to be left alone to its misery. Washington, Paris, and London need the ISIS bogeyman today, just as they needed al-Qaida and the Soviet Union before, to justify budget-busting new arms spending and keeping the population whipped up with bogus war fever. 
Internationally, the greatest threat to America’s security is, of course, nuclear armed Russia which has enough intercontinental and sea-launched missiles to wipe the United States off the map. Accordingly, Washington’s most important foreign and national security priority is maintaining calm, well-mannered relations with Russia and its leadership. 
Instead, we have Hillary Clinton and her frantic war party neocons trying to provoke Russia at every turn and giving Moscow the impression that she will start a war with Russia. It was precisely such war talk and sabre rattling that in 1983 during the Able Archer crisis brought the US and USSR to within minutes of a full-scale nuclear war. 
For all Trump’s bluster and Islamophobia, he is absolutely right about seeking good relations with Moscow. The schoolyard demonization of Russian President Vladimir Putin by the Clinton camp and its tame US media is childish, shameful and unworthy of a great power.  "
"MAINE GOVERNOR joins Kansas, Texas, and New Jersey in withdrawing from the federal (Muslim) refugee resettlement program Gov. Paul LePage is withdrawing the state of Maine from the federal refugee settlement program, citing a loss of confidence in its ability to safely and responsibly run the program. Maine has become one of the Obama Regime’s favorite dumping grounds for unskilled, illiterate, welfare-dependant large Somali Muslim families. Obama doesn’t need a religious test for refugees because most of them are Muslims WCSH6 (h/t kafir) In a letter Friday, Gov. LePage informed President Obama and notified the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) that Maine would no longer be participating in the program. “The federal government has proven to be an unwilling partner with states in ensuring that refugee settlement does not unduly put American lives at risk,” LePage wrote. Maine joins Kansas, New Jersey and Texas in severing ties with the ORR. In the letter, LePage included the case of refugee Adnan Fazeli of Freeport, who was revealed in August through an FBI investigation to have died last year while fighting for the Islamic State. “I sincerely hope that the federal government will re-evaluate its current refugee policy — both the quantity and nation of origin of refugees it resettles and the vetting process they are subjected in — in order to best protect the safety and interests of the American people,” LePage wrote. The typical size of Somali Muslim refugee families places an unfair burden on hardworking American taxpayers who must fund welfare for them According to LePage’s office, the governor has directed the state Health and Human Services Department (DHHS) to work with federal counterparts to implement a transition out of the ORR program. The ORR was created after the passing of the 1980 Refugee Act, which provided the legal basis. By withdrawing from the federal program, LePage has removed state workers from the integration assistance process but has not stopped refugees from entering or living in Maine."

Election Day may be just around the corner, but there’s still plenty of time for more dirt to be unearthed. Hillary’s neck-deep in the WikiLeaks revelations, of course. But it seems Trump’s not out of the woods yet, either. At least not according to the Daily Beast’s Justin Miller: A new, disgusting bombshell about Trump and women tonight @thedailybeast

Oh?"
"This morning a colleague asked if I had a prediction on the election. Of course, trying to predict the outcome today is a fool’s errand. I won’t even take a stab at it. Like literally everyone else in the country, I have no idea what is going to happen when results start flooding in.
And that’s what I said.
Then the conversation transitioned to one of us both picking a state we think the unthinkable might happen in. I chose Michigan .
Call it a hunch. Call it a feeling. Or call it hope. Whatever the case, I feel something special may happen in Michigan tonight and Donald Trump may be the benefactor.
I see a couple reasons for this. First, Michigan has no early voting. Right out of the gate this causes problems for Democrats and their heavy use (or abuse in many cases) of early voting. Democrats struggle with getting voters out on a single day, something Republicans tend to not only do well, but actually favor as traditionalists.
Second, Michigan has been hit hard by Democrat policy for decades. And Democrats can’t squirm their way out of blame on it. The collapse is on their shoulders. They know it, we know it and Michigan’s electorate knows it.
Third, Republicans have enjoyed a lot of recent success across Michigan. Michigan Republicans have been winning a lot of local, federal and statewide races as of late.
Fourth, the Trump campaign got wind of something that sent them to campaign heavily across Michigan in the final weeks leading up to today. It’s possible they just wanted to force Clinton to spend time and money up there, but I think it’s more likely they see something internally that suggests the state is in play.
Fifth, Bernie Sanders almost beat Clinton in Michigan. Her core support there is shaky at best.
Turns out my hunch may be proving possible in terms of voter turnout so far today. Indeed, there are wide scale reports of record turnout across Michigan.
Frank Luntz tweeted out saying the working-class turnout is extremely high and the Governor said “it looks like this precinct has had a lot of people turn out. I hope that happens throughout Michigan” following his vote earlier today.
Twitter is full of reports of long lines and busy precincts, many of which are in parts of the state Democrats don’t have full control over.
Will it be enough? Maybe not. But in August Clinton led the average of Michigan polls by 9.5%. Today her lead is within the margin of error.
Meaning that yes, Michigan is completely up for grabs. And it turns out there is a good chance Trump comes out with a win.

Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was dubbed a “high priest” and a “goddess of the occult” in a letter recently sent from Romanian hacker Guccifer to Fox News. 
The letter is receiving renewed scrutiny following revelations Friday that Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta attends bizarre occult rituals involving a mixture of breast milk, blood and semen in what is being termed the most disturbing email exposed by Wikileaks. 
Back in September, Fox News posted images of the letter it received from Guccifer, whose real name is Marcel Lazăr, postmarked September 16, 2016, in which he claimed the goal of the “Guccifer project” failed because he was unable to “fully expose the Illuminati / the council and their crimes.” 
Here’s a transcript of his letter: 
“The Romenian authorities query that I have to be sent back home “right away”, is a silly, hasty move, by the way. 
I will not leave this beautiful country without saying that the “Guccifer Project” was a failed project. My will / intention was to fully expose the Illuminati / the Council, and their crimes, but I failed! 
“Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the high priests, a goddess of this ocult, satanic, shadow group. One must see their evil and profoundly corrupt nature to understand what I am talking about. 
“Though I know I invested a great deal of time & effort trying to expose the crimes of the Rockefellers, the Bush klan, the Clinton, and many others, maybe my skills (or lack of skills?) were NOT matching my faith. 
“So, I apologize in front of the unknown soldiers who struggle to take this fight against these monsters to a glorious end. Many of ’em are risking their lives, while doing this behind the computer screens, from inside or outside the system.” 
On Friday Wikileaks dropped a shocking email showing Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and his brother being invited to a “spirit cooking” dinner hosted by performance artist Marina Abramovic, where a mixture of semen, menstrual blood and breast milk are bizarrely used as mediums to create a “painting.” 
In an email dated June 28, 2015, Abramovic wrote, “I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina.” 
Lazăr was sentenced to seven years in federal prison in May after he pled guilty to hacking the computer systems of high level government operatives, including Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. 
Lazăr also claimed it was easy to hack Hillary Clinton’s private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. "

"link a reply to: Profusion I must point out to you, that his statements are accurate. What is more, they are entirely appropriate to the situation. As we speak, proxy war is being fought by the destabilising forces of IS, sponsored by Western nations and interests by the back door, against the Assad regime. That regime is an ally of Russia. I am tired of pointing these things out, but to suggest that Russia is the problem, when for most of the last two decades, there has been western sponsored terrorism all over the most volatile region of the planet, smacks to me of the most unutterable witlessness. Russia is not the problem. I would not go as far as to say that it never was, and lets face it, the Russian government are not clean handed. But here is the thing... Russia cannot dishonour the British. It cannot dishonour the Americans. It can only make choices that make its nation look bad, and many of the choices it has made, with specific regard to its ACTUAL war effort against terror in Syria, have been absolutely legitimate, especially since they were not the cause of the problems there in the least. No... only OUR nations governments can dishonour us, and dishonour us they do. Every gun that makes its way from America and Britain, into the hands of a terrorist, dishonours us. Every time those weapons we sell the terrorists by the back door, are used to kill an innocent, we are dishonoured, stained with blood we would not wish to be shed. Our leaders, those of America and Britain not to mention other allies, THEY are the problem here. Their meddling, proxy warring, greed and hunger for power are the problem. They are the problem because we pay the taxes that make it possible. They are the problem because we did not give them permission to do these things in our name, because we would not want these things done in our name, and because they are supposed to be our representatives. No backstabbing, soft handed, work shy bastard represents me. No assemblage of schemers and game players represents me. No such mob represents my people on their best day, because on our best day the British people are not cold, evil, calculating and prepared to screw anyone to succeed. On our best day, even the least of us has more fair play and determination to do right than our government have. The same can be said a thousand fold for the leadership of the United States. We are not evil people, and yet we have allowed evil people to usurp the purpose of the tithe taken from our labour, to turn our effort, sweat and blood, into bloodshed overseas. We have had enemies made for us, by people we have mindlessly elected to positions with which they cannot be trusted. And we have the gall to be concerned about RUSSIA? I despair, I absolutely despair! This is not a game, this is not politics, this is real life. We should be doing better with it, and we are not. We should not be sliding ever further to the right, and yet we are. We should not be accepting the programming, and yet that is precisely what is happening all over the world, and in the OP of this very post. We MUST take back control of our governments. We MUST prevent our leaders from continuing these outmoded concepts of proxy war and destabilisation. We MUST mend the things our leaders broke in our name, we MUST take responsibility for those things, and we must NEVER allow them to happen again. In the meantime, we must leave Russia to deal with the crisis in Syria, so that the nation can be rebuilt, its infrastructure repaired, its homes and cities bought back to a livable state, and so that we are not distracted by a war that could turn from a pantomime into an even greater tragedy than it already is. I tire of this bizarre and ridiculous charade that we are apparently too stupid to stop, too uncaring to prevent. It needs to end, and end today, yesterday, TEN DAMNED YEARS AGO OR MORE! Can we stop accepting the lies, the obfuscations, the programming we have been fed? Can we PLEASE start doing that as a group? Would that be too damned much to ask? Because to be quite frank, if we cannot even do that, then we deserve to burn in nuclear fire for a hundred years, because we are not going to do ourselves any favours continuing such a pathetic existence as our leaders have created for us, cattle like and willing to believe whatever we are told, except that the sound of the bolt gun ahead is anything to worry about. edit on 27-10-2016 by TrueBrit because: grammatical error correction."
"Trump Win Jitters New World Order Financial Markets November 02, 2016 Trump Win Jitters New World Order Financial Markets 
(LONDON) - World stocks, the dollar and oil fell on Wednesday, while safe-haven assets such as gold and the Swiss franc rose as investors were rattled by signs the U.S. presidential race was tightening just days before the vote. Investors were beginning to rethink their long-held bets of a Nov. 8 victory for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton amid signs her Republican rival Donald Trump could be closing the gap, deepening the recent decline across major stock markets. Asian stocks hit a seven-week low on Wednesday, while European bourses followed Wall Street's lead overnight and slid to a four-month low. Bonds rose alongside gold, the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, with the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries falling for the third day in a row. British gilts, which have recently been slammed by uncertainty surrounding the post-Brexit UK outlook, surged too. 
""The lead up to the U.S. presidential election was always expected to be lively but the events of the last couple of days have seriously taken their toll on investor sentiment,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda in London. 
Investor anxiety has deepened in recent sessions over a possible Trump victory given uncertainty on the Republican candidate's stance on key issues including foreign policy, trade relations and immigrants, while Clinton is viewed as a candidate of the status quo.

Europe's index of leading 300 shares was last down 0.4 percent <.FTEU3>, having earlier hit a four-month low of 1,313 points. Britain's Britain's FTSE <.FTSE> and Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> fell 0.4 and 0.7 percent, respectively. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> dropped 1.1 percent to seven-week lows while the yen's rise to a two-week high helped push Japan's Nikkei <.N225> down 1.8 percent. 
U.S. stock futures recovered earlier losses, pointing to a fall of only 0.1 percent at the open. This would still signify a fresh four-month low for Wall Street. 
PRICING A TRUMP VICTORY 
The tumultuous presidential race appeared to tighten after news that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was reviewing more emails as part of a probe into Clinton's use of a private email server. 
While Clinton held a five-percentage-point lead over Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Monday, some other polls showed her Republican rival ahead by 1-2 percentage points. 
Barclays strategists estimate that a rise in Trump's polling odds to 50 percent could see the S&P 500 fall 4-5 percent, and potentially as much as 10-11 percent if he wins. 
This has unnerved markets and the CBOE volatility index <.VIX>, often seen as investors' fear gauge, rose to a two-month high above 20 percent. 
The tension in markets came as the Federal Reserve holds its two-day policy meeting, with its statement due later on Wednesday. While traders do not expect a rate hike just a week ahead of the presidential election, they are looking for signs that the Fed will move in December. 
Investors have grown increasingly confident in recent weeks that the Fed will follow through next month, attaching an 80 percent probability to such a move, according to fed funds futures pricing. 
But currency traders have sold the dollar this week in part because they suspect Trump would prefer a weaker dollar given his protectionist stance on international trade, and in part because the uncertainty surrounding a Trump win might lead to a more dovish stance from the Fed in the months ahead. 
The dollar fell again on Wednesday, after posting its biggest one-day fall on Tuesday in two months. 
The euro rose 0.4 percent to touch $1.11 for the first time in more than three weeks. It is up about two percent from its 7-1/2-month low of $1.0851 hit last week. 
Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.8 percent to 103.24 yen from three-month high of 105.54 yen set on Friday. 
""If you had a long dollar position on the view that the dollar would gain because Clinton would win, you would surely close that position because her victory is less certain,"" said Koichi Yoshikawa, executive director of financial markets at Standard Chartered Bank. 
Other safe-haven assets also rose. The Swiss franc hit a four-month high of 1.0750 francs per euro , its highest level since late June, while gold reached a four-week high of $1,297 per ounce. 
Oil prices fell for the fourth day in a row, sliding to one-month lows. Brent crude futures fell more than 1 percent to $47.53 per barrel, and U.S. crude was down as low as $46.06 . Oil has lost 10 percent in the last two weeks.

For many years men have struggled buying clothes that are not a suit or a pair of jeans, but finally we have made some progress. A team of scientists gathered from Oxford, Cambridge and John Lewis are said to be near to a clear definition of ‘smart casual’– somewhere equidistant between bland and gimp.

San Francisco, California – It was an agreement four years in the making, oftentimes marred by shouting matches among city hall officials, representatives of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, merchants and homeowners. But the Halloween party in San Francisco’s gay Castro district finally returns in 2014. 
It will be recalled that the Halloween bash attracted as many as 500,000 each year and has become a major tourist attraction, second and third only to the Pride parade and Folsom Street Fair. Stabbing and shooting incidents, believed to be perpetrated by straight revelers, prompted city officials to permanently ban the event beginning in 2010. 
As part of the agreement, the “new” Castro Halloween will be open only to members of the LGBTQ community who will have to register with city hall and be included in a “gay registry.” Registrants, who will take an oath admitting that they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or questioning, will be issued special identification cards linked to the official registry. The IDs will be the only accepted pass to gain entry to the Halloween event. ID’s will be scanned at entrances to the event to confirm that individuals are listed in the official registry.

"BREAKING: Trump Jumps in FL, Takes 4 Point Lead in OH 
Williams, who has publicly stated that he was not a Trump supporter, is nevertheless a man of honor and integrity. He doesn’t sell his values to common thugs who use bylines as weapons. 
According to both Williams and his attorney, Jonathan Franks, Jacob Bernstein from The Times approached Williams, asking for cooperation on a story alleging that people who live in Trump-branded buildings want the Trump name removed in light of the very difficult and contentious 2016 election season. 
Williams, an independent who lives in a Trump-developed New York building, declined to cooperate.   
According to Franks, Bernstein replied to a specific request not to print Williams’ address by stating he “would be more likely to extend that courtesy if Montel gave an interview.” 
Protecting another person’s privacy, especially the privacy of the ballot box, is not a special courtesy. It’s simply common decency. 
The Washington Examiner took their colleagues at The Times to task for this low-life journalism, noting that Williams identifies as a conservative but is not a registered Republican. He endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the 2016 GOP primary and has publicly credited Kasich for bringing him back into the conservative fold.

"Home / Be The Change / Government Corruption / Govt Corruption So Rampant, FBI Buys Billboards Asking Public to Rat Out Criminal State Agents Govt Corruption So Rampant, FBI Buys Billboards Asking Public to Rat Out Criminal State Agents Andrew Emett January 30, 2016 112 Comments 
Albany, NY – Instead of issuing Amber alerts for missing children or escaped fugitives, New York billboards are now asking government employees and ordinary civilians to report any state corruption directly to the FBI. Since 2012, at least 17 corrupt New York lawmakers have left office due to ethical or criminal issues. 
Earlier this month, billboards appeared along interstates throughout the capital city urging citizens to report corrupt politicians instead of drunk drivers. The FBI along with the New York Public Corruption Task Force and state Attorney General set up the billboards in an effort to delve deeper into the systemic subornation plaguing Albany. Prior to posting the anti-corruption billboards in New York, the FBI erected them last year in Connecticut and Kentucky. 
“The public plays an integral role in helping law enforcement root out corruption,” Andrew Vale, the FBI’s special agent in charge at the Albany division, told the Associated Press . “Which is why we try to make it easier to come forward and report suspected abuse.” 
But Assemblyman Daniel O’Donnell, a Manhattan Democrat who once headed the Assembly Ethics Committee, explained to the NY Daily News , “It seems to me that if someone is aware of corruption in any form, they don’t need a billboard to tell them. It’s not like the people don’t know what the FBI is and what they’ve been doing. But maybe I’m wrong.” 
In the last four years, at least 17 New York lawmakers have left office due to criminal or ethical issues. On December 11, 2015, former New York State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos and his son, Adam Skelos, were convicted of fraud, extortion, and soliciting bribes. On November 30, 2015, former New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver was convicted of seven counts, including conspiracy, fraud, extortion, and accepting roughly $4 million in bribes and kickbacks. 
On November 24, 2015, former New York State Senator Tom Libous was sentenced to six months of house arrest for lying to an FBI agent. On September 14, 2015, former New York State Assemblyman William Scarborough was sentenced to prison for wire fraud and theft. On July 24, 2015, New York State Senator John Sampson was convicted of obstruction of justice and making false statements to federal agents. 
Last summer, former FBI agent and New York Congressman, Michael Grimm, was sentenced to eight months in prison after pleading guilty to tax fraud. In connection with his guilty plea, Grimm admitted to exploiting immigrant workers, underreporting wages, and repeatedly lying under oath. Grimm was also caught on video threatening to throw NY1-TV reporter Michael Scotto off the balcony of the U.S. Capitol building and break him in half. Assemblymen Micah Kellner, Dennis Gabryszak, and Vito Lopez either resigned or failed to seek re-election due to allegations of sexual harassment. Assemblymen William Boyland Jr. and Eric Stevenson along with State Senator Carl Kruger were convicted of multiple counts of bribery. 
At least 34 New York legislators have left office due to corruption or misconduct since 2000, including 17 corrupt state officials since 2012. As Assemblyman Daniel O’Donnell explained, “Anybody who is a lawmaker who is unaware that the FBI is looking at us has other cognitive problems.” 
With a pervasive culture of corruption, New York now apparently requires billboards to remind government employees and civilians that the FBI desperately needs their help in catching the plethora of crooked politicians. Heaven forbid someone might take it upon themselves to tackle government abuse without the FBI’s assistance. The last contracted government employee to try that was Ed Snowden.

"  
Enemies of the United States are joyously watching its upcoming elections that are exposing this once great nation as deeply corrupt. It’s as if a huge rock has been turned over, exposing the swarming, slithering underside of America’s political system. 
For those who admire America, like this writer, this week is a time to weep for the republic. 
We see two candidates who are utterly unfit for the highest office: Hilary Clinton, engulfed by scandals, and blustering TV mogul Donald Trump, a man of profound shallowness who advocates Islamophobia, torture and environmental ignorance. 
Hillary Clinton’s core supporters are black food stamp and welfare recipients, and legions of women who are voting simply by gender. Trump’s core supporters are tax-paying workers who have watched Wall Street loot America’s economy and send their jobs abroad. 
Like many people, I’ve been tearing my hair trying to decide for whom to vote. I now favor Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson who gained worldwide fame as a dolt when asked about the destruction of Aleppo, Syria. ‘What’s Aleppo?’ asked this New Mexico Bismarck. 
Now that’s the kind of president I’d like to see. No more regime-changers and empire-builders. No more Imperial America. No more crusaders or world super power bullying. No more mucking around the world and acting as the globe’s enforcer. Let’s forget Aleppo, Beirut, Gaza, Tehran, Islamabad, the South China Sea and North Korea. 
We can no longer afford to play ‘Game of Thrones.’ We’ve got to rebuild bridges and airports, and clean the Augean Stables of Congress, America’s most corrupt institution. We just spent $2.8 billion on roads in remote Afghanistan while our own highways are crumbling. 
Such is the folly of imperialism. The old Soviet Union did something similar, allowing its domestic infrastructure and industry to fall apart while adventuring in Afghanistan, and deploying 55,000 tanks in the Red Army. These tanks were useful in putting down the heroic Hungarian Revolution of 1956 – 60 years ago this week – but for nothing else. 
But I fear that whoever wins the US election will very quickly face major problems for which they are woefully unprepared. Most obvious is the bloody mess the US has created across the Mideast. 
I just learned that Trump recently named, as Mideast advisor, a notorious Muslim-hating fanatic, who is a Lebanese Maronite Christian fascist. His advice will likely be to invade Lebanon and Syria and kill more Muslims. 
For her part, Hilary Clinton has long been a wholly-financed subsidiary of Wall Street and the mighty Israel lobby. Just have a look at the list of her largest donors. Her pro-Israel supporters are urging her to create a so-called ‘no-fly’ zone over Syria, which is code for full-scale war against Syrian government and Russian forces. Guess who will benefit from Syria’s destruction and disintegration? 
This supreme idiocy could lead directly to nuclear war with Russia, something I’ve been warning against for years. 
There has been no mention in the campaign of rebuilding the Arab world, ravaged by western imperial interventions. Little mention of some 12 million Syrian refugees created by the Saudis and US. Nor of five million Palestinian refugees, and who knows how many in Iraq, Libya, Somalia and now war-ravaged Yemen. And not a word about America’s stalemated war in Afghanistan. Nothing about a shaky Europe. Nor how to accommodate China’s rise. 
Instead, we’ve heard tirades against the phony ISIS, which is funded by the Saudis, and Hilary Clinton’s absurd claims that wicked Vlad Putin is somehow behind America’s foreign disasters. It’s stupid and shameful demagoguery. 
At least Trump has the good sense to urge that we end our pointless confrontation with Russia and scale back the unaffordable American Empire. Few Americans know that almost half their government’s budget is spent on the military. 
Besides disgusting many Americans, the presidential campaign has made the US an object of derision and embarrassment around the globe. Many analysts claim that this grand fiasco marks the beginning of the end of US global hegemony. It’s certainly the beginning of the beginning. 
This week alone, the Philippines and Malaysia, two staunch American allies, edged closer to China’s camp. Neither Trump no Clinton had a care for America’s reputation during their ugly debates. 
My fear is that the election vitriol will not end America’ shame and misery but continue on, like an acid eating into the national fabric."

An important question is on the 2016 election state-wide ballot in Massachusetts. Question 2 deals with the state’s charter school cap. Without the cap, upwards of 12 charter schools could be approved by the state district in the next fiscal year. The charter school scam has spread its tentacles into the state ofMassachusetts in large part due to the Obama Administration. A vote ""no"" is thus critical toward halting the march of privatization in the education system occurring nation-wide. As Massachusetts residents gear up to vote for the next President of the United States, it is important to remember that the transformation of public education into a private good will not cease as long as popular opposition fails to confront its roots in Washington.
The Obama Administration immediately created the Race to the Top program after the 2008 election. This program paved a direct path toward the elimination of public education as we know it. The Department of Education funneled billions of US dollars into incentive schemes to privatize public schools district by district. Federal funds were dangled in front of mostly poor, mostly Black cities as long as these districts met the ""mandates"" of the program. These mandates included the closure of ""failing schools,"" mergers with for-profit charter schools, and the complete transformation of public schools into charter laboratories. Race to the Top created favorable conditions for private capitalists to engulf the entire US public education system.
The results have been disastrous. Hundreds of public schools have closed around the country. Tens of thousands of public school teachers have been fired. In New Orleans, nearly every school operating in the district is a privately owned by "" publicly funded"" charter schools .The Chicago teachers union recently averted a strike but has been dealing with the consequences of the closure of fifty schools in the city in 2013 .
The impact of charter schools has extended beyond teacher layoffs and school closures. Charter schools have also promoted segregation based on race and class. The Civil Rights Project of UCLA has found that seventy percent of black charter school students attend intensely segregated charter schools . Furthermore, charter schools also demand an even more intense policy of standardized testing withcurriculums that are often guided by the test corporations themselves. All the while, these institutions have found ample time to discriminate against ELS and disabled students.
In addition, charter schools have been found to cheat students from a quality education. Charter schools are even more militarized than traditional public schools and sport higher rates of suspension and expulsion rates. Corporate charter operators also ""cream"" students from the top and toss the rest. Even so, charters have not proven to do any better than public schools in terms of test scores . What the charter school movement does possess is the backing of the elite, which has masterfully used media and non-profit manipulation to demonize public education.
The usual capitalist players have been the primary leaders in the drive to rid of the charter school cap in Massachusetts. The New York Lobbying group ""Families for Excellent Schools"" is controlled by Hedge Fund managers whose funds stem from donations from the Walton Family (i.e. Wal-Mart). Another organization, ""Education Reform Now Advocacy,"" has received upwards of 11 million dollars from the same source . Charter schools are often labeled ""public"" because they receive tax payer dollars. However, the schools are accountable to no one except the corporate interests that back them.
A ""Yes"" vote on Question two would place the education of students in Massachusetts firmly in the hands of the kingpins of privatization. Not only would twelve charter schools per year be subject to approval, but forty-five public schools would be in danger of closure. Over 100 million more dollars per year would be siphoned from public schools across the state. At the moment, the charter school cap allows the state to operate no more than 72 charter schools. If the cap islifted, however, this restriction would no longer apply and leave the students, families, and educatorsvictimto the ""shock and awe"" privatization which has characterized national policy for over two decades.
Opposition to privatization is being led by the organization Save Our Schools. Save Our Schools consists of families, teachers, students, and unions that are looking to prevent an era of unbridled privatization in the Massachusetts public education system. Charter schools already drain 450 million from public education in the stateeach year as it currently stands. A vote ""no"" would protect public schools and thus the unions that representtheir educators.
A ""no"" vote would build upon numerous labor victories in the Massachusetts area over the last few years. The Boston School Bus Drivers union Local 8751 won a historic victory against the Veolia Corporation in 2015. The Harvard Dining Workers of Local 26 UNITE HERE followed by defeating Harvard's bid to raise healthcare costs in October of 2016. Now it is time to stand with teachers across the state in their effort to prevent full-scale privatization.
Doing so will not be easy. The model of union-management cooperationwith theDemocratic Party continues to prevent workers in Massachusetts and across the country from taking offensive action against the privatization assault. A vote ""no"" on question 2 in Massachusetts would show that community and union members can organize a successful push-back against the forces behind privatization. However, a vision of transformation and radical change must be articulated if defense of public education is to materialize into a people's movement. The fight against privatization must be placed in the contextof the larger struggle to build a world that working and oppressed people would vote ""yes"" to."

TEENAGERS in the county Tipperary town of Clonmel have today called for a public apology from adults, politicians and gardaí after they were incorrectly blamed for murdering a local cat with a firework. 
Reputable news publications originally reported the claim as fact, but have since taken down their misinformed story without a correction, which said the cat was ‘targeted by unknown individuals who strapped a firework to its mouth, killing it’. Pictures of the dead cat were then circulated online for maximum effect. However, a post-mortem this morning has revealed the cat was in fact killed in a hit and run incident – a conclusion backed up by Gardaí, who reviewed CCTV of the incident which revealed the cat was struck by a car. 
“Too be honest, I do be too skagged out of me head to be chasin’ cats and wasting heroin money on fireworks,” Clonmel teen Martin Dunphy told WWN today, “T’was gas how quick all de straight heads pointed the finger at us, and then it turns out it was one of their own drivin’ a car. We demand an apology… or a few euro for the bus if ye have it?” 
Clonmel gardaí have since closed the investigation, despite the driver of the vehicle being at large in the area, sparking conspiracy claims around the town. 
“It’s one law for us, and another for them,” voiced another teenager, “If they can do this to an animal, the worry is what they’ll do to a person”. 
Since the revelation, youth campaigners have set up a Facebook page, Cats Lives Matter, calling for justice for the animal, urging gardaí to relaunch a full investigation into the “hit and run”."

"Yesterday we saw a black teenager take a Trump poster and gleefully tear it up. It was a shopping area in Duval County Jacksonville, FL. Not downtown. What does it mean? That for many, political activism means vandalizing private property and suppressing freedom of speech. (yours not theirs) 
An acquaintance who is in Chicago says his wife is voting for Hillary because it is time for a woman POTUS. He says he cannot speak about Trump at home or a riot starts, but says he is voting Trump because all Hillary’s campaign does is attack Trump, no policy. AT LEAST Trump has a plan. When I mention Benghazi, he says he is sorry about military casualties but those who enlist know the risks. I guess that it was diplomats running guns for Obama, doesn’t matter, 
So these are mature people who run a business (3 rd generation), and this what filters through to them. This is the level of comprehension. So he volunteered the info that he was voting for Trump, and I do not abuse him or speak excessively about politics with him, and I forget what we were chatting about when it came up. He says he goes to church regularly and considers himself ‘religious’, but when speaking to him, he is pretty fuzzy about what the Bible says about forgiveness. If Trump loses and then buys an island and starts a country, I’d be interested in the costs involved. If Trump loses this country will not offer much of a future for my kids or grandchildren."
"ITALIAN MAYOR blasted for scathing verbal attack on African Muslim savages who have been invading Southern Italy Yes, his words may be racist and anti-Muslim, but look at the videos below to see what African Muslim illegal alien invaders are bringing to Italy and you won’t be so quick to condemn him. What would you say if they did the same thing in your cities? Thousands of Muslims lift their asses to Allah in front of the Coliseum in Rome to protest the government’s closing of hundreds of illegal mosques UK Express (h/t Brenda K) An Italian mayor has come under fire after saying he will shoot ’niggers and gypsies’ and build a pig farm next to mosques as tensions continue to rise over the illegal alien Muslim invasion of southern Italy. More than 160,000 economic freeloaders posing as asylum seekers have been housed in Italy since the start of 2014, according to date from the interior ministry. Italy has been one of the first destinations along migrants typical routes for months, receiving thousands of new arrivals who continue to risk their lives to cross the Mediterranean on rickety smuggler’s boats. But many have been critical of the welcoming of so many refugees – and now one Mayor from the town of Albettone in Vento has launched a scathing attack on the new arrivals. Speaking on La Zanzara on Radio 24, Joe Formaggio said: “Immigrants? If they send them to us, we will protect our houses. We are proud to be racists.” The mayor claims his city “exports brains and imports niggers” who “are less intelligent than us, they are inferior”. Amid possible plans to open a mosque in the city, he claimed he would open a “large farm of pigs if they open a mosque here”. Mr Formaggio added: ”If refugees are sent here to Albettone, the barricades in Gorino will be seen as nothing. “Here we do not want immigrants, niggers or gypsies. They have a lower IQ: history proves it. “We have a shooting range and the highest number of licenses to carry weapons in the whole Veneto region. “And we do not want anyone to come and bother us. They risk their lives around us.” The comments were deemed so strong that the Secretary General of the Vicenza Chamber has been forced to intervene. Calling the comments “irresponsible”, Giampaolo Zanni said: “The Chamber of Vicenza totally rejects the Mayor of Albetton’s statements about the black population. “None of us underestimates the problems arising from illegal alien Muslim invasion migration. “But responses like those of the Mayor of Albettone are not only xenophobic and racist, but are also dangerous as they encourage feelings of racial hatred, and therefore are in stark contrast to the values of our constitution.” Thousands of Italians have come out in large protests against the never-ending Muslim invasion of their country."
"People Shocked At What Hillary Brought With Her To Speech During Scandal Posted on October 30, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton landing and speaking in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on Friday 
Hillary Clinton is attempting to forge through the FBI investigation, which she hopes people will soon forget, as she refuses to accept defeat at the hands of Donald Trump. As she carries on with her sparsely-planned campaign stops in the final days of the election, Iowans were shocked to see what she brought with her to her speech right after the investigation was announced. 
No matter how hard Hillary tries, everything she hides seems to have a way of coming out. Karma is certainly working in favor of the American citizens who deserve to know the truth about this woman trying to bully her way into the White House. 
When she was in Iowa this weekend, just hours after the FBI announced they are re-opening the investigation into her e-mails thanks to her right-hand woman’s dirty husband, Hillary brought a familiar “friend” that the public couldn’t ignore, which is why photos of it have now gone viral. During the second presidential debate, we were first introduced to Hillary’s ironic nemesis, which wasn’t just her opponent Donald Trump. 
A fly pestered the Democratic candidate on live TV as she spoke, sticking to her and never touching Trump in what seemed symbolic since she stinks of lies and everyone knows flies are attracted to garbage. As embarrassingÂ as this may have been for Hillary, she can’t pass it off as a random event since it happened again in a completely different state. That’s right â while she was in Iowa, a fly once againÂ wouldn’t leave her face. Can't even make this up. How many times has a FLY landed on Crooked Rotten Hillary now?!

Apparently, there’s something about Hillary’s face that flies flock to. and it’s probably the same thing most Americans find so repulsive. It’s not coincidental that this has now happened twice to this candidate in less than a month, and perhaps the fly is just a sign of what the FBI investigation is about to uncover. 
Like a crow symbolizing death, the black fly during this election represents the end of Hillary’s campaign since it seems to sense everything she’s trying to hide."

Google uses an algorithm to decide which search results are first shown to a user, while Facebook arranges the order of the news feed, and decides to include certain posts from a user’s liked pages and friends, at the expense of others. Both sites also promote links to news articles, often based on a user’s own media interests. Read more Germany orders Facebook to stop collecting data on WhatsApp users 
These algorithms are at the core of the intellectual property of any social media or search website, and comprise some of the most highly-protected trade secrets in the world, potentially worth billions. No internet giant has ever revealed its inner workings. 
Merkel did not specifically name Facebook, Google or Twitter, but implied that the large platforms are creating “bubbles” of self-reinforcing views, and squeezing out smaller news providers. 
""The big internet platforms, via their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through to reach users,” warned Merkel. “This is a development that we need to pay careful attention to.” 
The internet giants themselves have argued that the so-called social media bubble is largely a myth, and that online users have a wider access to differing views than under a pre-internet model, where most news would be acquired from just a handful of newspapers and one or two TV channels. German establishment raises ‘Sword of Damocles’ over social media 
This is not the first attack on social media by Merkel and her Grand Coalition government, and while the German politician advocates diversity of views, she has previously accused it of perpetrating opinions that are most at odds with those of the establishment and traditional media.

Last month, Merkel accused AfD, the recently-established anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim party, which receives overwhelmingly negative coverage in most newspapers, of “spreading their lies” through social media, as it achieves breakthroughs in regional elections around the country. 
A year ago, at the height of the refugee influx into the country, Merkel, who was first elected in 2005, was caught on a hot mic personally pressing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to clamp down on anti-migrant posts during a UN session in New York. 
A fortnight ago, the leader of Merkel’s parliamentary CDU faction, Volker Kauder, said that social media should be fined €50,000 for failing to remove “hate speech,” saying that a “Sword of Damocles” has to hang over social media. Kauder also called for warnings, similar to those on cigarette packs or before entering pornographic websites, to be given to those about to go on social media.

"Archives Michael On Television 10 Things That Every American Should Know About Donald Trump’s Plan To Save The U.S. Economy By Michael Snyder, on September 15th, 2016 
Can Donald Trump turn the U.S. economy around? This week Trump unveiled details of his new economic plan, and the mainstream media is having a field day criticizing it . But the truth is that we simply cannot afford to stay on the same path that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have us on right now. Millions of jobs are being shipped out of the country , the middle class is dying , poverty is exploding , millions of children in America don’t have enough food , and our reckless spending has created the biggest debt bubble in the history of the planet . Something must be done or else we will continue to steamroll toward economic oblivion. So is Donald Trump the man for the hour? 
If you would like to read his full economic plan, you can find it on his official campaign website . His plan starts off by pointing out that this has been the weakest “economic recovery” since the Great Depression… 
Last week’s GDP report showed that the economy grew a mere 1.2% in the second quarter and 1.2% over the last year. It’s the weakest recovery since the Great Depression – the predictable consequence of massive taxation, regulation, one-side trade deals and onerous energy restrictions. 
And Trump is exactly right about how weak this economic recovery has been. 
So how would he fix things? 
The following are 10 things that every American should know about Donald Trump’s plan to save the U.S. economy… 
#1 Donald Trump would lower taxes on the middle class 
The tax savings under Trump’s plan would actually be quite substantial for middle class families. The following numbers come from a recent Charisma article … 
• A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill. 
• A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill. 
• Married couple earning $5 million per year with two children and $12,000 in child care expenses will get only a 3% reduction in their tax bill. 
#2 Donald Trump would lower taxes on businesses 
Under his plan, no business in America would be taxed more than 15 percent. Alternatively, Hillary Clinton’s plan would tax some small businesses at a rate of close to 50 percent. So Trump’s plan would undoubtedly be good for businesses, and it would encourage many that have left the country to return. 
But where would the lost tax revenue be made up? 
#3 Childcare expenses would be exempt from taxation 
For working families with children this would be a great blessing. Without a doubt this is an effort to win over more working women, and this is a demographic that Trump has been struggling with. 
It is definitely an idea that I support, but once again where will the money come from to pay for this? 
#4 U.S. manufacturers will be allowed to immediately fully expense new plants and equipment 
This would undoubtedly lead to a boom in capital investment, but it would also reduce tax revenue. As an emergency measure this would be very good for encouraging manufacturers to stay in America , but it would also likely increase the budget deficit. 
#5 A temporary freeze on new regulations 
Red tape is one of my big pet peeves, and so I greatly applaud Trump for this proposal. I think that Bob Eschliman put it very well when he wrote the following about Trump’s planned freeze on new regulations… 
In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Studies show that small manufacturers face more than three times the burden of the average U.S. business, and the hidden tax from ineffective regulations amounts to “nearly $15,000 per U.S. household” annually. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion dollars per year, and Trump will end it. 
#6 All existing regulations would be reviewed and unnecessary regulations would be eliminated 
In particular, Trump’s plan would focus on getting rid of regulations that inhibit hiring. The following are some of the specific areas that he identifies on his official campaign website … The Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan, which forces investment in renewable energy at the expense of coal and natural gas, raising electricity rates; The EPA’s Waters of the United States rule, which gives the EPA the ability to regulate the smallest streams on private land, limiting land use; and The Department of Interior’s moratorium on coal mining permits, which put tens of thousands of coal miners out of work. 
#7 Donald Trump would fundamentally alter our trade relationships with the rest of the globe 
Donald Trump is the first major party nominee in decades to recognize that our trade deficit is absolutely killing our economy. I write about this all the time , and it is a hot button issue for me. So I definitely applaud Trump for proposing the following … Appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to win for America: narrowing our trade deficit, increasing domestic production, and getting a fair deal for our workers. Renegotiate NAFTA. Bring trade relief cases to the world trade organization. Label China a currency manipulator. Apply tariffs and duties to countries that cheat. Direct the Commerce Department to use all legal tools to respond to trade violations. 
#8 Donald Trump’s plan would be a tremendous boost for the U.S. energy industry 
Barack Obama promised to kill the coal industry, and that is one of the few promises that he has actually kept. Obama also killed the Keystone Pipeline, and right now the energy industry as a whole is enduring their worst stretch since the last recession. To turn things around, Trump would do the following … Rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions including the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Save the coal industry and other industries threatened by Hillary Clinton’s extremist agenda. Ask Trans Canada to renew its permit application for the Keystone Pipeline. Make land in the Outer Continental Shelf available to produce oil and natural gas. Cancel the Paris Climate Agreement (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius) and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs. 
#9 Trump would repeal Obamacare 
Trump claims that Obamacare would cost our economy two million jobs over the next ten years. And without a doubt, it has already cost the U.S. economy a lot of jobs . 
Not only that, but Obamacare has also sent health insurance premiums soaring, and this is putting a tremendous amount of financial pressure on many families. 
Trump says that he would “replace” Obamacare, but that is a rather vague statement. 
What exactly would he replace it with? 
#10 Trump’s plan says nothing about the Federal Reserve 
This is a great concern, because the Federal Reserve has far more power over the economy than anyone else does. It is at the very heart of our debt-based system, and unless something is done about the Fed our debt bubble will continue to get even larger. 
Since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen by more than 96 percent and our national debt has gotten more than 5000 times larger. For Trump to not even mention the Federal Reserve in his economic plan is a tremendous oversight. 
We are in the midst of a long-term economic decline, and things have not gotten better during the Obama years. If you can believe it, a study that was just released by Harvard even acknowledges this … 
America’s economic performance peaked in the late 1990s, and erosion in crucial economic indicators such as the rate of economic growth, productivity growth, job growth, and investment began well before the Great Recession. 
Workforce participation, the proportion of Americans in the productive workforce, peaked in 1997. With fewer working-age men and women in the workforce, per-capita income for the U.S. is reduced. 
Median real household income has declined since 1999, with incomes stagnating across virtually all income levels. Despite a welcome jump in 2015, median household income remains below the peak attained in 1999, 17 years ago. Moreover, stagnating income and limited job prospects have disproportionately affected lower-income and lower-skilled Americans, leading inequality to rise. 
That same study found that the percentage of Americans participating in the labor force peaked back in 1997 and has been steadily declining since that time… 
If we continue to do the same things, we will continue to get the same results. 
Donald Trump is promising change, and many of his proposals sound good, but there are also some areas to be concerned about. 
Ultimately, just tinkering with the tax code and reducing regulations is not going to be enough to turn the U.S. economy around. We need a fundamental overhaul of our economic and financial systems, and Trump’s plan stops well short of that. But without a doubt what he is proposing is vastly superior to Hillary Clinton’s plan, and so he should definitely be applauded for at least moving in the right direction.

I have never felt as depressed – about my own future, about the future of my friends, my family and my country- as I do at this very moment. William Lutz 
Mondo I’m feeling the same way. Everyday the life is being sucked out of our wonderful nation with each passing day. I’ve noticed it ever since the 2008 crisis, but even more so after Obama got reelected. The only thing we have to do now is hope for the best of our personal lives in the next few years. This downfall is inevitable. anonymous

Another stupid tickle down economy by the GOP.. We should be taxing the rich . Obama regulation and energy policies protect us from global warming Obama health care help the poor and sick .. repealing Obamacare will hurt all the economy gains we seen the last 8 years..

What I’m saying is.. If you vote for Trump and you’re single and admit to voting for him,.. a lot of women won’t want you. GSOB 
Let me be blunt – God called women into spiritual leadership roles, as an exception to His design, in order to shame the men into bringing the nation back to God, and into exercising their God given responsibility to lead in the church, the home and in the nation. 
In no way does the Bible EVER paint women in leadership roles as a positive thing, but it is something God uses to shame the men into action. SnodtBlossom

Michael this is one of the best articles you have ever written. You presented Trump’s solutions to issues that plague everyday Americans. Well done. This is not satire. 
Trump should replace Ocare with the free market and nothing else. William Lutz 
Replace Obamacare with individual Health Savings Accounts based on investments. Public hospitals with vouchers is also a great idea. South Texas 
No, the government needs to get out of looting me with a ‘savings account’ and make it free market all the way. GSOB 
You don’t understand how it works. They don’t tax those dollars you put into a HSA. Orange Jean 
Except that in most of them… you select a certain $$ amount each year… and if you don’t use it, you lose it. Who do you think ends up with the money then? GSOB 
Don’t expect a reward for being careless. No system can sustain carelessness South Texas 
Exactly my point. Why do we have to put up with some over compensated elected person to ‘let’ me do something with my money? 
I’ve never had a use for an HSA but known people who do. But hey, at least the scum implicitly acknowledge they are cheating us by ‘giving’ us the privilege to use our money pre-tax. 
If some of us were not working almost 5 months of the year to support government and we had a real private health insurance and health care sector, this would be a non issue. SnodtBlossom

How much prior political experience does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!! He talks the talk, but never walked the walk. But hey.. it’s only THE PRESIDENCY! Maybe next we’ll grab people off the street w/no medical training to do surgery! 
Neither did Ulysses Grant or Dwight Eisenhower have a prior politcal position, though both had a strong military background. Dwight being ” The Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War II” and Grant “Commanding General of the United States Army” How much military background does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!! 
“no major U.S. company has filed for Chapter 11 more than Trump’s casino empire in the last 30 years.” He has filed four business bankruptcies. Maybe he thinks it’s just as easy to file bankruptcy w/the entire government and walk away. Raymond Chow 
Political experience means nothing especially when someones political experience means the detriment of the nation. Cobbett 
”How much prior political experience does Trump have”

How much military experience does Hillary and Obama have zilch none! jonodough 
you mean like the idiot obama? Mondobeyondo 
If she doesn’t have a coughing epileptic seizure before the election. LIZ THE SHIZ 
yup, the fix is in just watch the electoral college , your vote don’t mean squat!!! GSOB 
Not yet it don’t Raymond Chow 
Why do people always mention electoral college when they don’t understand what electoral college is? 
When looking at the map of blue or red those are just projections where Democrats or Republican voted favorably in the past it doesn’t mean electoral college. Electoral college delegates are pick by the winning candidate in the state. All states in the national election are winner take all. So if the candidate wins in majority of the district in the state he wins all the state electoral college. LIZ THE SHIZ 
just like super delegates, seems fishy budman 
nebraska is not winner take all. each congressional districts electoral vote depends on the vote within that district. GSOB 
And the minimum wage will go up. And unemployment will rise, and government will spend even more. Orange Jean

Yep! krinks 
Hey Genius. A Free Market solution led people to be denied coverage for nearly every malady under the guise of a pre existing condition. A Whistle Blower for/from the Health Insurance Industry admitted as much. The more she came up with creative reasons to deny payment/coverage the higher she was promoted. GSOB 
The free market is the best thing going! Because it has some level of risk, non hackers despise and envy this good system. What makes it good is that it benefits the majority of the people, not all. No system can. What happens if the majority are non hackers? Non hackers default to handout mode by finding fault with reality and cry, they depend on a leftist government to provide a silver spoon for everyone. The market then is no longer free. krinks 
Weren’t you paying attention? They take your premiums and then when you need to use it deny payment. GSOB 
Appeal it then. krinks 
Appeal? To who? The same person who gets a bigger bonus for telling you no? Are you an idiot? GSOB 
You sound like a confident young man. Just ignore me. Stick with your leftist ideas. Your choice. Jace Tate

well he opened it up to a Trollathon Raymond Chow 
When people runs out of argument or loses they start calling names which is exactly what you are. Yes, you sue or appeal your case. krinks 
I explained that a big bonus follows when you tell people NO in the private industry. If you don’t understand this YES you are an IDIOT. Jerry C 
Then payers should be free to leave and go to a provider who says yes in a fair market. LIZ THE SHIZ 
meanwhile you die waiting for the appeal Raymond Chow 
Then sue them or perhaps you didn’t sign up for the coverage. It’s like you got liability for your car insurance but you wanna be cover for medical when you get into an accident. joe 
That’s how “insurance” works. Simply banking in reverse and how the inventors, IE banksters intended. Raymond Chow 
Yes, a free market system where you can acquire health insurance across state boundaries. I.e., wish to buy health insurance in Iowa where it’s lower even though I live in California. Cobbett 
Why are people so obsessed with their health? Why paying endless 10000s on the chance I ”might” get ill…rather spend it on women and booze. Lillian DeVore

He should, but he said that he wants universal healthcare. turee60 
I agree our medical the way it was was still the best in the world. People from Canada were coming here for medical cause it was so much better. The government doesn’t need to get into our medical. Years ago like in 1986 I was out of work and had no medical and went to a free clinic in my area and got waited on quickly and it didn’t cost me anything. William Lutz 
I agree. On one hand, some of Trump’s policies sound alright, but a lot of his proposals are dubious and a few are unrealistic. First of all, building a YUGE wall on the border is going to be very expensive and not very effective. Furthermore: 
1) He never really mentions how he is going to deal with Planned Parenthood. 2) He obviously has no full intention of abolishing some bureaucratic agencies such as the Fed Reserve, the FDA, the USDA, Department of Energy, etc. 3) Reckless spending and debt is going to continue, and tax revenue will never keep up with the expenses. 4) I am not sure how he is going to replace Obamacare. 5) His idea on how to combat ISIS is not practical. It would mean extorting the Middle East out of their oil and having a costly militarist operation in various countries. It’s a recipe for World War 3. 6) Even though he is anti establismhment at heart, he is running on a major party platform, which is rigged and corrupt. He should’ve refused to participate within the Republican Party and join an alternative political party. Jace Tate 
Isis took the oil didn’t they William Lutz 
Yeah they probably took it, but my point is that you don’t easily defeat ISIS by confiscating the oil and having a double version of the Iraq War. By the way, I forgot to mention that DJ Trump never spoke openly about civil liberties or mass surveillance either. Hence, I suspect that he will strengthen the so called “war on terror”, which God forbid he would do. No more George Dubya Bush please. Christopher Privett 
Obama expanded Bush’s programs of surveillance, and just paid Mexico 75 Million dollars. For a WALL built across their southern border. John Francis 
You are right, some things don’t add up, but I’ll take him over Hillary any day of the week. I’m still struggling with whether to vote in the presidential at all, having a very hard time with Trump’s torture advocacy and his call for the execution of Edward Snowden. Jessy Scholl 
Seriously, Donald Trump can’t talk about abolishing federal agencies because he would be killed on the spot. Jace Tate 
how are lower taxes going to help zero growth? How is income in the middle class going to aid the systems recovery? Once you go off the cliff of a set system in a fixed economy, you don’t think there is any fixing it. I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer. However the way the apple is peeled can only be determined post collapse, after the decision makers have decided the direction the country takes. That is why even if you take out the true deplorables ruining everything, the best you can do is elect someone who identifies with the American way of life and our decisions. themacabre 
How are higher taxes for failed government programs going to help?…we need to cut federal spending not give it more money. That’s like giving a lazy bum watching tv and drinking beer another six pack. ISA41:10 
” I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer. ” 
How stupid can you be?!?!? Explain to me how taking more money from the private sector (businesses and people) improves growth and the economy? 
Waiting .. JC Teecher 
You are proof of how well mind control by the elite liberals is working. It is this mentality that is meant to destroy the God induced US Constitution. 
When a nation has allowed four scotus to take the whole nation down a rat hole of sin, then the nation either digs back out or it gets drowned in darkness. 
There is a slim…very slim chance that America can dig out of the rat hole for a few years, but ultimately sin will drown this nation into the abyss.

"Thu, 31 Mar 1994 21:37 UTC 'Magic trick!' Washington — The White House has portrayed the commodities market trading that netted First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton almost $100,000 in a two-year period as a case of an ordinary small investor who took her chances and came up a winner with shrewd judgment and a little guidance from an experienced friend. But experts and officials in the volatile futures trading industry said Wednesday that what she did would be highly unusual for the average small investor to pull off successfully . And many commodities trading firms would never have allowed such an investor to try it. For one thing, the experts said, her activities involved exposure to possible losses in the unpredictable market for farm commodities futures that substantially exceeded the available capital--losses that potentially could have been greater than her family's net worth if the market had turned sharply against her. Normally, commodities specialists said, an inexperienced investor with such limited assets would not be allowed to run the risks Mrs. Clinton did unless she had the backing of--and perhaps financial guarantees from--a wealthy backer. At the time she made her huge profits, starting with an initial capital investment of just $1,000, Bill Clinton was a rising political star in Arkansas but he and his wife had only modest assets. They did not even own their own home. Yet Mrs. Clinton took surprisingly large positions in cattle futures, earning one-day profits as high as $30,000 . Had the market moved the other way, she could have lost huge amounts virtually overnight, according to market specialists. The White House has insisted that Mrs. Clinton risked her own money, made all decisions herself about when to buy and sell and bore full responsibility for any losses. They have said that she got advice from prominent Arkansas lawyer James B. Blair, but also consulted other advisers and studied the market through the Wall Street Journal . Futures market analysts and officials who have examined the records of her activities, however, question whether a responsible broker would have allowed her to trade the way she did without some kind of financial protection. One commodity trader with 30 years' experience who reviewed the records of Mrs. Clinton's market activity said that her account is highly unusual, both in the frequency and size of trades and in the small amount of capital behind them . ""There's no way in the world that Hillary Clinton should have been trading 50 (cattle futures) contracts. That's 2 million pounds of beef. The risk posture is just not consistent with (the Clintons') income and net worth,"" said this trader, who works for one of the nation's biggest brokerage houses. ""We would not let either one of them (the Clintons) trade commodities. In the late 1970s, we required a couple hundred thousand dollars in liquid net worth before we let them in the door to trade commodities . This is not for the faint of heart,"" the broker said. Another commodities trader, Phil Tiger of Smith Barney Shearson, described the First Lady's successful trading as ""unusual and fortuitous, and her timing was perfect."" He said that she entered the market just at a point of rocketing growth and rode it until she had made a small fortune. ""It surprised me she stuck it out as long as she did. Most novices just take their profits and get out,"" Tiger said. But other market experts noted that s hortly after Mrs. Clinton ceased trading, her broker, Robert L. (Red) Bone, and the brokerage company, Ray E. Friedman & Co., were disciplined by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for ""serious and repeated"" violations of exchange rules on margin requirements and record-keeping functions at their Springdale, Ark., office. Margin is the amount of cash a trader must put up versus the amount of borrowed money used to make the investment. Bone was suspended from trading for three years. The brokerage was fined $250,000. White House officials have said that Mrs. Clinton was unaware of allegations that her brokerage was allocating successful trades to clients or that Bone had previously been suspended for trading violations. Elliot Bercovitz, vice president for strategic planning at Lind-Waldock Inc., of Chicago, one of the nation's leading commodities trading firms, said that it was possible at the time to turn a small stake into $100,000 with savvy trading in the booming market in cattle futures. But one transaction caught his and a number of other brokers' attention: the very first trade in October, 1978, when her account balance went from her initial $1,000 investment to $6,300 in one day. There is no documentation for what was traded at what price, but some brokers said that she could not possibly have had enough in her account to cover the large position in cattle futures that she would have had to take to make that much profit that quickly. "" There are holes in these records ,"" said John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Assn. and a former official in the Richard Nixon Administration who examined the Clinton trading records. ""They show the original $1,000 and next day $6,000. How does that compute? ""Her $1,000 wouldn't margin the cattle position on that day, necessary to create the profit on the next day. Maybe there was more than $1,000 up front, maybe there were some guarantees."" ""Most firms weren't taking small individual investors like Hillary Clinton. This is a professional's business. But somehow, Hillary Clinton made $100,000 very quickly , and I would be remiss as president of the FIA to allow the general public to believe this is commonplace,"" Damgard said. Neither Blair nor Bone was authorized to trade on Mrs. Clinton's behalf, White House officials said. Blair offered ""advice but no guarantees,"" said a senior White House official familiar with Mrs. Clinton's trading who asked not to be named. ""He wasn't backing her trades and he wasn't custodian of her account,"" the official said. On Wednesday, Blair and Bone did not respond to telephone calls from The Times . The White House official familiar with Mrs. Clinton's trading said that the initial $6,300 profit was based on a single futures trade but that the First Lady could not locate the documentation for it. From that first trade, Mrs. Clinton traded aggressively, staking out ever-larger positions and booking profits of more than 3 to 1 over losses. When the market began to go sour in May and June, Mrs. Clinton switched from betting on rising cattle prices--taking a ""long"" position--to betting that the market would fall, or selling ""short."" In June, she took a very large short position in cattle futures, selling them three weeks later in mid-July for a quick profit of almost $25,000. Her boldness astounded market observers who have reviewed her record. ""That was a very large and aggressive position. . . . This is heavy-duty trading by someone who was not averse to taking risk,"" said Bercovitz. After that series of trades, Mrs. Clinton stopped trading, took a check for $60,000 from Friedman & Co. and never re-entered the market in any substantial way. ""She got the money and walked away,"" Bercovitz said. ""You've got to give her credit."" Other brokers question how she could have taken such risks without the means to cover potential losses. "" It would take a person of enormous wealth to take on 50 contracts of cattle, as she did ,"" said a trader involved in similar transactions at the time. ""If they lost, where would the Clintons come up with $100,000 to pay for it? They didn't have it."" Comment: She may have had an 'in' with people setting cattle prices. As for collateral, the Clintons were in the business of collecting secrets and trading political favors (also known as blackmailing). They never had any problem getting rich with other people's money."

In case this election wasn’t already infuriating enough, here’s something that’s really going to make your blood boil. With hours to go before polls close, voter watchdog groups across the country are reporting that many laser tag establishments are staying open today. 
This is seriously alarming news. 
In what appears to be a concerted effort to prevent Americans from casting their ballots on time, dozens of laser tag locations are keeping normal business hours on Election Day, inviting one and all to enjoy nonstop laser tag action with all the coolest terrain and equipment. 
If true, this could represent voter suppression on an unprecedented, scarcely conceivable scale. It’s appalling to see laser tag places—some of them located within blocks of polling stations in swing states—deploying everything from signs to roadside billboards to social media posts in an attempt to stop Americans from exercising their civic duty. Just take a look at this truly disgusting tweet: 
George Washington is rolling over in his grave right now. 
According to Leanne Holst, spokesman for the watchdog group Voter Vigilance, laser tag may only be the tip of the iceberg. 
“Some of these laser tag facilities are continuing to operate roller rinks, 18-hole mini golf courses, and go-kart tracks in a shameless ploy to lure voters as far as possible from the booths,” said Holst. “It’s an utterly transparent tactic, and the saddest thing is just how effective it can be. Laser tag arenas represent a grave, immediate threat to the democratic process.” 
Below, via Voter Vigilance, is a partial, ongoing list of laser tag places that have not closed for Election Day, and several with the sheer audacity to offer off-peak, daytime discounts. Lightspeed Go-Karts & Laser Tag (Greenfield, WI) Code Red Laser Tag (Dallas-Fort Worth, TX) Laser Tag Kingdom (Monroe, NH) QZAR (Carle Place, NY) Laser Quest (numerous locations nationwide) Zap Zone (Sterling Heights, MI) Battle Blast Laser Tag (Las Vegas, NV) Lazer Kraze Laser Tag (Erlanger, KY) 
If you know of a laser tag place in your district that remains open today, do not be silent. Post their names and pictures in the comments so that we can put a stop to this assault on democracy before any further damage is done."

"Home / Be The Change / Mark Ruffalo Delivers Mobile Solar Trailers to Standing Rock Camps in Preparation for Harsh Winter Mark Ruffalo Delivers Mobile Solar Trailers to Standing Rock Camps in Preparation for Harsh Winter Jay Syrmopoulos October 30, 2016 2 Comments 
Cannon Ball, ND – In a show of kindness and solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux, actor Mark Ruffalo and Native Renewables founder Wahleah Johns presented Sioux tribal elders with mobile trailers equipped with solar collection arrays. The trailers provide a clean energy source for the protest encampment where over 500 Native American tribes have taken a stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline in the largest gathering of American Indians in modern history. 
“This pipeline is a black snake that traverses four states and 200 waterways with fracked Bakken oil,” said Ruffalo, co-founder of The Solutions Project, a venture that works to transition society to clean and renewable energy. 
“We know from experience that pipelines leak, explode, pollute and poison land and water. But it doesn’t have to be that way.” 
The solar trailers will allow for medical tents and numerous other critical facilities to be powered with clean energy, and represent exactly the healthy/abundant future of energy for which the Standing Rock Sioux are currently fighting. 
“Water is life,” said Johns, a Navajo leader. “By leading a transition to energy that is powered by the sun, the wind and water, we ensure a better future for all of our people and for future generations.” 
According to a report by EcoWatch : 
Johns’ company, Native Renewables, promotes low-cost clean energy solutions for Native American families throughout the U.S., with an emphasis on job creation and on benefiting the community as a whole. The trailers were built by members of the Navajo nation and were financed by Empowered by Light and Give Power. 
Research led by Stanford Prof. Mark Jacobson, another Solutions Project co-founder, shows that it would be technically possible and economically beneficial to transition to 100 percent clean renewable energy in each and every state across the country. In North Dakota, for example, wind and solar energy would be the primary sources of clean power and transitioning to 100 percent renewables would create 30,000 jobs. 
The reality of the situation is that the Standing Rock tribe is fighting to protect their source of clean water. The Dakota Access Pipeline puts the tribe’s clean water supply, as well as that of millions of others, in danger, as the pipeline is scheduled to go directly under the Missouri River. 
— Dan Zukowski (@danzukowski) October 25, 2016 
The construction of the “black snake” marks the conglomeration of corporate/banking interests being elevated above that of the public interest. Furthermore, the ongoing construction has already desecrated sacred burial sites and cultural artifacts. “Around the world, more than 80 percent of the forests and lands with protected waterways and rich biodiversity are held by indigenous tribes. This is no coincidence,” Ruffalo said. “As so many of us suffer from polluted water, air and land in our rural and urban communities, the water defenders at Standing Rock are showing us another way.” 
Imagine how you would respond if an oil pipeline was being dug through the cemetery where your grandparents and great grandparents were buried. 
Mark Ruffalo taking a stand for the Standing Rock Sioux is a great example for all individuals, celebrity, and non-celebrity alike. Rather than simply donating some money to a cause, he has utilized his celebrity to bring much greater attention to the continued injustices being perpetrated against the Native American community. 
It’s clear that Ruffalo has taken a page out of Ghandi’s book, and is “being the change he wishes to see in the world.” 
Please share this inspiring human story — and take a stand for Standing Rock! Share"
"BNI Store Nov 7 2016 BIGGEST MUSLIM LIE OF THE DAY: “White supremacists are openly threatening Election Day violence…so the FBI is hassling Muslims” Is it the inbreeding? Or just that they think they can promote any fantastical lie or obfuscation and the Kardashian-worshipping American public won’t notice. It’s been reported for days that The Islamic State/al-Qaeda is calling for the “slaughter of U.S. voters” on Election Day. But that didn’t stop officials from designated terrorist group CAIR from inventing a fake potential threat against Muslims…to deflect the fact that the FBI is questioning potential terror-linked suspects in the Muslim community. USA Today Ritz Katz, director of the SITE Intelligence Group, said Saturday on Twitter that the threats appear in an essay carried by the Islamic State’s Al Hayat media center that declares militants “have come to slaughter you and smash your ballot boxes.” 3) #ISIS urges Muslims to refuse participate in #Elections2016 & to announce that they “have come to slaughter you & smash your ballot boxes” 
— Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) November 5, 2016 “May Allah make this year’s U.S. presidential election a dreadful calamity like no other to have struck America throughout its pathetic history,” the seven-page manifesto, entitled “The Murtadd Vote ,” read. Murtadd is an apostate who turns his back on Islam. The essay, which uses lengthy religious arguments in an effort to justify such attacks, also declares there is no difference between the Republican and Democratic parties in their “policies against Islam and Muslims” In an article from the perpetually Muslim-sympathizing Fusion website: As if Muslim Americans haven’t had it hard enough during this presidential campaign—what with Donald Trump’s steady drumbeat of Islamophobic racism–now comes reports that federal agents are paying surprise visits to Muslims across the United States ahead of the November 8 election. According to officials from the Council on American Islamic Relations, representatives from the FBI have questioned Muslims living in at least eight states leading up to November 8, reportedly searching for information pertaining to a possible Election Day al Qaeda threat . Over the weekend, the designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American Islamic Relations) received reports from Muslim-Americans in eight states, who said they were approached by FBI agents who wanted to speak to them about the alleged threat. Those states included California, Washington State, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kansas Oklahoma, Florida and Texas. Hassan Shibly, executive director of CAIR’s Florida offices, called the reported questioning “completely outrageous,” and “borderline unconstitutional,” telling the Washington Post : “That’s the equivalent of the FBI visiting churchgoing Christians because someone overseas was threatening to blow up an abortion clinic. It’s that preposterous and outrageous.” The people who were interviewed this weekend were asked if they knew anyone who might want to harm Americans at home or abroad. Shibly said all of those interviewed appeared to be of Afghani or Pakistani descent. Shibly says such sweeps are dangerous to Muslim-American relations.’Unfortunately we’re dealing with an environment that’s not very friendly to American Muslims,’ he said. ‘The environment is very hostile to the American Muslim community.’ On Twitter, CAIR’s Dallas-Fort Worth director Alia Salem posted a short video updating her followers about the FBI visits, and offering a series of resources for anyone approached by law enforcement. “It was made apparent to us that the FBI has a list of a couple hundred people they are wanting to visit,” Salem told the Dallas Morning News . “And ask a series of eight generic questions intended to drum up information about the attacks.” The FBI’s sudden scrutiny of Muslim Americans comes as the United States is experiencing a surge in white nationalism and militia groups , fueled in no small part by Donald Trump’s KKK-backed candidacy . Militant Trump supporters have, in fact, explicitly stoked fears of violence come Election Day. (But it’s Muslims who actually carry out terrorist attacks on Americans) “Prior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,” Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the anti-American, Muslim-funded Southern Poverty Law Center told Reuters . “Now these ideas are legitimized.” Perhaps while the FBI is questioning Muslim Americans over vague international threats, they should check in with some of the no-longer-fringe radicals on America’s far right wing, too."
"Russia’s Most Potent Weapon? Rapidly “Hoarding Gold” As Global Currency War Is Upon Us Posted on Home » Gold » Gold News » Russia’s Most Potent Weapon? Rapidly “Hoarding Gold” As Global Currency War Is Upon Us 
The Next World War Will Be Fought With Gold… 

by Jay Syrmopoulos. The Free Thought Project via SHTFPlan : 
Editor’s Comment: He who holds the gold makes the rules? Fresh attempts at containing Russia and continuing the empire have been met with countermoves. Russia appears to be building strength in every way. Putin and his country have no intention of being under the American thumb, and are developing rapid resistance as the U.S. petrodollar loses its grip and China, Russia and the East shift into new currencies and shifting world order. 
What lies ahead? It will be a strong hand for the countries that have the most significant backing in gold and hard assets; and China and Russia have positioned themselves very well. Prepare for a changing economic landscape, and one in which self-reliance might be all we have. 
Russia is Hoarding Gold at an Alarming Rate — The Next World War Will Be Fought with Currencies 
by Jay Syrmopoulos 
With all eyes on Russia’s unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which NATO has dubbed the “SATAN” missile, as tensions with the U.S. increase, Moscow’s most potent “weapon” may be something drastically different. 
The rapidly evolving geopolitical “weapon” brandished by Russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold, as well as Russia’s native currency, the ruble. 
Take a look at the symbol below, as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order – potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift – and much sooner than you might think. 

The symbol is the new designation of the Russian ruble, Russia’s national currency. 
Similar to how the U.S. uses the dollar sign ($), the U.K. uses the pound sign (£), and the European Union uses the euro symbol (€), Russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally. 
After the failed “reset” in U.S./Russian relations by the Obama administration, and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship, Washington began targeting entire sectors of the Russian economy, as well as specific individuals, meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force Moscow into compliance. 
Instead of decimating Russia, what it precipitated was a Russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the U.S. petrodollar, and working with China to create an alternative to the SWIFT payment system that isn’t solely controlled by Western interests (see Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, New Development Bank). 
According to the Corbett Report: 
New reports indicate that China is ready to launch its SWIFT alternative, and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of de-dollarization that is seeing the BRICS-led “resistance bloc” breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the US-led “Washington Consensus.” 
For those who don’t know, SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and is shorthand for the SWIFTNet Network that is used by over 10,500 financial institutions in 215 countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world. SWIFT does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself, but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions. Still, given the system’s near universality in the financial system, it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the SWIFT network. 
This is why de-listing from the SWIFT network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the US and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns. 
Recently, financial guru Jim Rickards, author of the book “Currency Wars,” wrote that “Russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy. Russian bonds and stocks and the Russian currency, the ruble, will all benefit.” Rickards believes a “strong turnaround” is coming within Russia, and that this comeback will benefit the ruble. 
While still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the U.S., Russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar, there remains a clear and present danger of the Russian economy being devastated by the whims of Washington. 
The Bank of Russia, that nation’s central bank, is extremely clear about its mission, and monetary policy declaring on its website: 
Monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing well-being of Russian citizens. The Bank of Russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflation-targeting regime, and sees price stability, albeit sustainably low inflation, as its priority. Given structural peculiarities of the Russian economy, the target is to reduce inflation to 4% by 2017 and maintain it within that range in the medium run. 
In layman’s terms, that means that monetary policy, similar to nuclear weapons and the military, are “an integral part of the state policy” in Russia. While many analysts have noted the increased build-up in Russia’s military arsenal, seemingly few have highlighted the massive build-up of Russian gold reserves over the past decade. 
Below is a chart showing Russian gold reserves between 1994 and last year, 2015: 
Since 2006, there has been a year-on-year increase that reveals a significant upward trend. The chart clearly reveals that Russia’s state policy of increasing state monetary assets, in the form of gold. Additionally, the Russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets. From 2006 to 2015, Russia’s state holdings of gold tripled. 
Within just the past year Russia has substantially increased its gold holdings 
According to the Business Insider: 
In July of this year, the central bank of Russia added 200,000 ounces of gold to its reserves. The one-month uptick in Russian gold reserves — 200,000 ounces — is approximately equal to the entire annual output of Barrick Gold’s Turquoise Ridge gold mine in Nevada. 
At that same rate — 200,000 ounces per month — in a mere five months, Russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of Barrick’s massive Goldstrike mine in Nevada. 
Currently, Russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world. It’s clear that there is a concerted effort by Russian authorities to build up the country’s gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the United States. 
Rickards, in his 2011 book “Currency Wars,” theorized that Russia and China could combine their gold reserves to form a global gold-backed currency to compete against the U.S. dollar. Currently, Russian reserves stand at roughly 1,500 tonnes, with Chinese reserves totaling over 1,800 tonnes (according to China — it’s likely more), which would amount to a combined total of roughly 3,300 tonnes of gold. 
The U.S. is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus the U.S. lockup on global gold is about to vanish, according to Business Insider. 
Imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that Russian-Chinese alliance could exercise indirect (or even direct) control over the IMF’s gold reserve of over 2,800 tonnes. Russian, Chinese and IMF gold combined would equal roughly 6,100 tonnes, and would allow for direct competition with the U.S. gold reserves, estimated at 8,100 tonnes. 
Russia and China have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by Washington as it’s weapon of choice when opposing a well-armed state, and clearly see the writing on the wall – thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm. 
The reality is that the United States is $20 trillion dollars in debt, and eventually the time will come when the U.S. economy begins to implode — and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper it’s printed on. Hard assets, such as gold and silver, should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so, as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the U.S. using the petrodollar as a “weapon.” 
Ultimately, the United States, Russia and China are all controlled by centralized power-hungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the IMF, the World Bank, SWIFT, New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 
It’s not Russian nuclear weapons that people should fear, as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a first-strike nuclear attack. The true threat to America is our economic house of cards, built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the “rights” of corporations over that of people .

AN POST’s stamp lickers union have called for a ballot on industrial action to take place as more and more public sector pay workers fight for better pay and working conditions. 
Chronically dry tongues are just one of many long term effects that An Post’s stamp lickers can suffer from as they lick close to 2,000,000 stamps a year. 
An archaic hangover from British rule, An Post has always kept a division of saliva rich workers in their GPO HQ despite advancements in postage stamp adhesive technology. 
“Some of our older customers just prefer things the old way, when you’d come up O’Connell St and the stamp lickers would be there in their kiosks with their tongues hanging out waiting for a customer to swipe a stamp across them,” explained head of An Post’s Stamp Lickers Division Tim Kinitty. 
Stamp lickers are demanding longer breaks and pay restoration as well as an acknowledgement from the government that the demands of the job have changed significantly. The government has previously rejected a proposal whereby staff is paid double for licking an envelope/ 
“The stamps never used to be this feckin’ big when I first started,” explained the longest serving stamp licker in Ireland, 81-year-old Edith Drury, “me tongue is battered from all those fancy commemorative stamps the hoors in government or councils or wherever are always commissioning. I deserve more pay surely”. 
According to latest estimates, the only profession left that hasn’t explored the possibility of strike action are auld lads who whistle as they walk to the shops to grab a few messages."
"Home / Badge Abuse / Breaking: Emergency Call to Action at Standing Rock as Police Violently Attack Prayer Ceremony Breaking: Emergency Call to Action at Standing Rock as Police Violently Attack Prayer Ceremony Jay Syrmopoulos November 2, 2016 11 Comments 
Cannon Ball, ND – Law enforcement responded violently to water protectors attempting build a wooden footbridge across a creek linking the main Native encampment and the Dakota Access Pipeline construction area for a prayer ceremony. The police responded with a vicious assault on the peaceful water protectors. Breaking: hundreds of #NoDAPL water protectors attempting to cross foot bridges built over Cannonball river to reach DAPL construction area 
The Guardian reports : 
The US army corps of engineers has ordered North Dakota police to arrest Native American protesters and destroy a bridge that activists built over a creek at the center of the increasingly tense Dakota Access pipeline demonstrations. 
The Morton County sheriff’s office announced on Wednesday that police were in a “standoff with protesters on the banks of the Cantapeta Creek” while activists said they were engaged in a peaceful water ceremony. 
The situation raised concerns that there could be more mass arrests and violent clashes with police. 
The tense situation erupted into state sponsored violence as law enforcement began spraying water protectors attempting to cross the creek with pepper spray, with reports of a water protector being shot in the back by a non-lethal round. 
The situation on the ground is tense and many there feel that this conflict is coming to a head with these latest police actions. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has given the county orders to remove the makeshift bridge and arrest any protesters who cross the Cantapeta Creek for criminal trespass, according to Morton County spokeswoman Donnell Preskey. 
“Protesters involved in this activity are violating numerous federal and state laws,” Pesky said. 
According to a report by Forum News Service : 
The Corps owns a sliver of land on the north side of the creek, Preskey said. Citing free speech rights, the Corps has been allowing hundreds and sometimes thousands of Native Americans and other pipeline protesters to camp on Corps land south of the creek along the nearby Cannonball River since Aug. 10 Variety of officers have been regularly spraying water protectors with pepper spray; more await in boats nearby. pic.twitter.com/y5ep8PczqK

Tomorrow, election day will be only one week away. In this post I want to talk about two distinct subjects. First, I want to talk about the sort of calculation that a Martian might make when confronted by the choice we will face in the voting booth. Then, I’d like to paint a brief picture of what election day would look like, in a world where I didn’t want to claw out my eyeballs. 
A Martian Looks at Election Outcomes in 2016 
I say “Martian,” because a Martian is so detached that the 30,000-foot view looks like a close-up, and I think in this election detachment is a virtue (see above at “claw out my eyeballs”). 
So a Martian would feel that despite the all the sound and fury, the numbers have not been that crazy (assuming one trusts them). Among registered voters: Emphasizing how remarkably stable the &#39;16 race has been — going back to Sept. 2015 https://t.co/odFykkIm8m pic.twitter.com/2CKuS9Qi9G 
&mdash; Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) October 31, 2016 
RealClearPolitics has a similar chart averaging all the polls with a vertical scale that makes the swings a lot bigger. To me, the pattern of the race is that Clinton starts out with, and retains, a natural institutional advantage of around four points. Again from the head-to-head RCP chart, Trump has closed and then pulled even six times: September 2015, December 2015, February 2016, May 2016, July 2016, and September 2016. And each time either Clinton’s institutional advantages have re-asserted themselves, or Trump has shot himself in the foot (take your pick). Trump is closing now. Can he pull ahead and close the deal? Unknown. Based on past performance, no. Then again, as I remarked before the latest email eruption, “a week is a long time in politics,” Wikileaks has yet to drop its final shoe, and each campaign probably has a garbage truck full of oppo fired up and ready to go. 
Paradoxically, Martians are not warlike, since the thin air, small population, and harsh conditions on Mars make war a species-threatening event. For the same reason, Martians prize the deep memories of elders while treating every child as precious. And Martians resist “Marsization,” because the one time there actually was a single, Mars-wide, cosmopolitan class of elite overlords they tried to invade the Earth, and who knows where that would have led! So if you were a Martian, and you believed that Clinton’s election would lead to a new war , and you believe that endorsing Bowles-Simpson and “hemispheric trade” in a speech at Goldman Sachs mean a Grand Bargain and TPP passage respectively, then you might look askance at a likely Clinton victory. What do do? If you had a Martian friend who followed American elections obsessively — this is similar to Southeast Asian countries where people obsessively follow English Premier League football — this is what your friend might tell you: 
The last thing you want is for Clinton to be able to enact her (real, private) agenda. Sure, she might make some small good changes, but if you throw war, a Grand Bargain, and the surrender of national sovereignty with another so-called trade deal on one side of the scale, it’s hard to see what outweighs them on the other, at least in terms of concrete material benefits.[1] So, working on the assumption that Clinton will win, what you need is: 
A Republican House . Here, the checks and balances built into the American system favor gridlock, and gridlock is your friend, since little legislation will get passed. Whether the House Republicans impeach Clinton if the Senate is in Democrat hands is an open question, but with Clinton having privatized the email server for her public office and the shenanigans at the Clinton Foundation , the Clinton administration will provide a target-rich environment. I woudn’t put it past them to try to take Clinton’s security clearance away! 
A Democrat Senate . The emergence of left(ish) party barons with independent power bases is the untold story of election 2016. Warren is at least sound on banksters and financial power, and Sanders, while not a Bolshevik, is well to the left of the Democrat mainstream. That’s a Good Thing. Both are prolific fundraisers who don’t need the DNC. If the Republicans hold the Senate, the tendency will be for Democrats to stick together. If the Democrats do, then Baron Warren and Baron Sanders (and allies like Sherrod Brown ) will feel more free to drag the party left. 
A close race . If Clinton wins, she’ll claim a mandate if the margin is a tenth of a percent. But in the same way that anybody can print money, but the trick is getting other people to accept it, others will be less likely to accept her claim the closer the result is. (I think the result would have to be better than the four points Obama beat Romney by — 51.1% to 47.2% — and as of today, Clinton’s margin is 2.8% in RCP’s four-way average .) Of course, Bush claimed a mandate in 2004, too — true story: I managed to Google-bomb “Bush mandate” to Mandate magazine, back in the day when Google-bombing wasn’t hard — and proceeded to try to gut Social Security, whereupon the Democrats promptly gutted him and went on to win the 2006 mid-terms. But why make it easy? 
So, that’s the Martian perspective on the race. Surprisingly or not, the personal characteristics of puny Earthling candidates are not a factor! Nor are cultural or class markers! 
Elections on Mars 
Here is how Election Day works on Mars. Again because of planetary and cultural characteristics, Martians reserve tricky and complex electronic devices for important things, like distributed Martian parallel chess, or space operas. They are also convivial, and they hate to be manipulated by large and opaque forces (that time the Jovians invaded). Obviously, I can’t provide links for most of this — the Uniform Resource Locator is a global standard, not an interplanetary one — but in short form: 
1. On Mars, Election Day is a national holiday. That’s because Martians, unlike American Earthlings, think that everybody should have an equal opportunity to vote. Voting is equally easy for almost every Martian, whether they work or not. 
2. The Martians use hand-marked paper ballots, hand-counted in public. This is remarkably similar to international standards on Earth (which the United States does not use): 
Last March, the country’s highest court found that secret, computerized vote counting was unconstitutional. Unfortunately, the country was Germany, and the Constitution violated by e-voting systems was the one that the U.S. wrote and insisted Germans ratify as part of their terms of surrender following WWII. 
Paul Lehto, a U.S. election attorney and Constitutional rights expert, summarized the German court’s unambiguous, landmark finding : “No ‘specialized technical knowledge’ can be required of citizens to vote or to monitor vote counts.” There is a “constitutional requirement of a publicly observed count.” “[T]he government substitution of its own check or what we’d probably call an ‘audit’ is no substitute at all for public observation.” “A paper trail simply does not suffice to meet the above standards. “As a result of these principles,…’all independent observers’ conclude that ‘electronic voting machines are totally banned in Germany’ because no conceivable computerized voting system can cast and count votes that meet the twin requirements of…being both ‘observable’ and also not requiring specialized technical knowledge. 
Hand-counting paper ballots is no good at all, argue critics, unless you really want to know who the actual winner of the election was… 
After the verdict in the case — filed by a computer expert and his political scientist son — Lehto wondered how it could be that open, observable democracy is seemingly an inviolable right for “conquered Nazis,” but not, apparently, for citizens of the United States… 
3. The Martians throw a big party at the precinct after the paper ballots have all been hand-counted. That’s partly because Martians are convivial, but also because the Martians think that democracy is important and ought to be celebrated. (Again, because the Martian population is small, they wish to begin the conciliation process between winner and loser immediately, lest fratricidal violence result, and there’s no better way to do that than over food.) 
4. The Martians regulate all forms of political advertising for size (small) and frequency (not often), whether for candidates or policies. That’s because the Martians wish to minimize manipulatio by encouraging face-to-face forms of persuasion and deliberation in public venues wherever possible. 
5. The Martians ban published polling data thirty days before the election. That’s because Martians believe that they each should vote for their own reasons, and that elections (unlike markets) are not (manipulative) beauty contests. 
Conclusions 
Crazy Martians! What are they thinking? 
NOTES 
[1] Sadly, the time for an all-out assault on Republican “obstructionism” was 2009, when all the stars had aligned: The Republicans had no credibility, and the Democrats had the House, the Senate, the most powerful orator of our time (so it was said), in the White House, and a mandate for “hope and change.” Of course, Obama (assuming good faith) squandered this opportunity, starting with his inaugural speech, if not before.

"By wmw_admin on October 28, 2016 Joe Barnes — Daily Express.com Oct 27, 2016 The Veliky Novgorod ready to launch. Click to enlarge 
The Veliky Novgorod is the latest addition to Russia’s Black Sea fleet which is capable of striking land, sea and underwater targets, and follows other significant movements by the Russian navy. 
The diesel-electric vessel, which sports advanced stealth technologies and increased combat range was officially launched in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. 
Deputy Commander of the Russian Navy Vice-Admiral Aleksandr Fedotenkov and Admiralty Shipyard CEO Alexander Buzakov were in attendance at the official flag-raising ceremony before the vessels moved to the Black Sea for operation. 
Earlier this month, Mr Buzakov said that another Varshavyanka-class submarine, the Kolpino, would be launched in November. 
He said: “The state of tests of the fifth submarine, the Veliky Novgorod, were successfully completed and on October 25 it will be handed over to the Black Sea Fleet. 
“The transfer of the sixth submarine, the Kolpino, is underway, scheduled to be completed on November 25.” 
The submarines are designed for anti-ship and anti-submarine operations in mid-depth waters, are capable of holding a crew of 52, have a top underwater speed of 20 knots and a cruising range of 4000 miles. 
They can stay submerged for 45 days and are armed with 18 torpedoes and high surface-to-air missiles and will join Russian efforts to defeat ISIS in Syria. 
Russian President Putin has also bolstered his warship fleet in the Baltic sea by arming them with long-range missiles which are capable of striking Europe. 
Two ships, traveling through the Mediterranean in the fleet of five, were thought to be remaining in the sea, where they were due to refueling in Spain before making their way towards Syria. 
But instead, the two ships have moved through the North Sea, passing through the Great Belt around Denmark and into the Baltic Sea. 
It is believed the ships are on their way to Russia’s Baltic enclave Kaliningrad, which has recently had scores of missiles deployed to the area. 
A source told Russian media: “With the appearance of two small missile ships armed with the Kalibr cruise missiles the Fleet’s potential targeting range will be significantly expanded in the norther European military theatre.” 
Nato has stepped up its plans to deploy thousands more troops to the Russian border as President Putin continues to increase his nation’s preparation for war. 
The global alliance will use its meeting with European Union officials to launch an aggressive push to implement troops in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 
An agreement – signed at a Nato summit in Warsaw in July – will see as many as 4,000 soldiers stationed close to the Russian border in case Moscow launches all out war."

"Europe Hopes for Clinton Win for More Deals With Iran November 01, 2016 Europe Hopes for Clinton Win for More Deals With Iran 
After a year of disappointment, European businesses are hoping a victory for Hillary Clinton in the U.S. election next week may help break the logjam that has prevented large-scale Western investments in Iran since the opening of its economy. While no one in Europe is predicting a flurry of new deals should Clinton defeat her Republican rival Donald Trump on Nov. 8 A win for the Democrat would remove some of the political clouds hanging over last year's nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Business groups say this could help fuel a more aggressive push into the Iranian market in 2017, especially in the second half of the year, if a Clinton victory is followed by the re-election of moderate Iranian President Hassan Rouhani next May. 
""If Clinton and Rouhani win, then we will have a political window of opportunity that is much bigger than we have now,"" said Matthieu Etourneau, who advises French firms on the Iranian market for MEDEF International, the French employers group. 
""This is what the European banks and companies are waiting for,"" he said. 
Back in January, when the United States and Europe lifted sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program, the excitement in Europe's business community was palpable. 
With a population of 78 million and annual output higher than that of Thailand, Iran was the biggest economy to rejoin the global trading and financial system since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. 
European politicians flocked to Tehran with dozens of corporate executives in tow. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013 on a platform to reduce Iran's isolation, traveled to Paris and Rome to promote his country to eager investors. 
But within months the euphoria had vanished, replaced by frustration on both sides. 
BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO IRAN DEAL: US LAWS 
The biggest obstacle for European firms seeking to do business in Iran has been the reluctance of the continent's largest banks to finance deals out of fear they could run afoul of U.S. sanctions and incur massive penalties down the line. 
The United States has taken steps to reassure the banks. Last month the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued new guidance to allay concerns about doing U.S. dollar transactions with Iran. 
READ MORE: DONALD TRUMP SAYS THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S FOREIGN POLICY WILL LEAD TO WORLD WAR THREE 
But Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged at a think-tank event in London this week that banks remained skittish. German officials raised their concerns about the hurdles during a recent visit by U.S. sanctions coordinator Daniel Fried. 
This caution is likely to persist, regardless of who is sitting in the White House. Beyond the issue of sanctions, the poor state of Iranian banks after a decade outside the international financial system, the strong state role in the economy and a lack of clarity about the legal system are all deterrents to foreigners. 
""Everyone knows now that this will be a long, step-by-step process to build up our economic ties,"" said Friedolin Strack, head of international markets at the Federation of German Industries (BDI). 
Still, a Clinton victory would be a reassuring signal to Europe. Her close adviser Jake Sullivan was a key figure in the secret negotiations in Oman that paved the way for the landmark agreement that curbed Iran's disputed nuclear activity, and she has defended it during the election campaign. 
Trump, by contrast, has called it ""one of the worst deals ever made"" and promised to renegotiate it if he is elected. Bankers say the risk of the deal unraveling under a Trump presidency has contributed to the reticence in Europe. 
Recently however, there have been signs of movement. 
Smaller German banks, pressed by their clients to support them in Iran, are beginning to offer limited financing and payment services. 
""Medium-sized banks that finance the German Mittelstand have a great deal of interest in Iran business and are preparing the groundwork intensively,"" said Siegfried Utzig, acting head of economic policy and international affairs at the Association of German Banks (BvB).

"Putin Still Hopes to See Moderate Rebels Separated From Nusra Front by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has officially rejected a request from his nation’s Defense Ministry to endorse a resumption of Russian airstrikes against the Syrian city of Aleppo, after 10 straight days of no Russian airstrikes being conducted. 
Russia launched a brief ceasefire in Aleppo last week, and extended it for four days. Even after it officially expired, they have not resumed strikes against the city, with officials saying they want to convince Western nations to separate the moderate rebel factions within East Aleppo from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. 
So far that’s not been working so well, as indeed separating the two was the primary goal of a weeklong ceasefire a month ago, and a public US call to separate never amounted to anything. After that, the idea appears to have been given up on by the US, and Russia has also sought Turkey and Saudi Arabia’s influence on the more moderate factions. 
As the rebel factions are launching a new offensive trying to brief the Aleppo siege, the Russian defense ministry has gone to the unusual step of publicly announcing their request to Putin, and Putin’s very public rejection may suggest there is some debate within the Russian leadership on how to proceed.

And it’s not Bernie Sanders supporters coming out to support Hillary. It’s not Barack Obama supporters coming out to support Hillary. It’s a new surge of Trump voters, many who have never registered to vote. Many who have not voted in eight or ten elections so they’re not reported in the polls… 
…I know for a fact that the polls are off because they oversample Democrats by eight sometimes up to sixteen percent oversampling Democrats. They’re oversampling women by five to eight percent. So the Republican vote is underreported. Plus there is no way to sample this extra twenty to twenty-five percent of new voters that are Trump voters. They’re not Republican, they’re not Democrats, they’re pragmatists. They’re tired of the status quo and they want change."

"posted by Eddie Most school kids watch the clock during the last few classes of the day, watching the time steadily tick until they can run home and play, hang out, or sleep, depending on the age. Watching the clock is not a sign of immaturity since we understand it can sometimes be difficult to sit in one place and concentrate on difficult tasks for an extended period of time. This habit often follows us through life as we settle into jobs and careers. It could be that we love our work, but around three and four o’clock, we begin to fidget. We start thinking about the things we will have to do when we get home, like shop, go to the gym, make dinner, or attend a special event. The last two hours tick away more slowly than the first two. This innovative Swedish company has found the solution to this problem. You will be so jealous! The 6 Hour Work Day for Sweden Filimundus is a Swedish mobile app developer where this idea was originated. The board of directors analyzed their employees and noted the difficulties in maintaining efficiency and concentration for eight hours. It was almost impossible for most of the workers. They had to take breaks to clear their heads and try to muster up more focus for the remainder of the day. This wasted a lot of potentially productive time. 
The board of directors found the perfect solution, a six hour work day, with wages left unaffected. They tried it out and discovered that the employees could complete the same amount of work within six hours which they were originally doing within eight. This new practice increased their efficiency at their jobs and left more time and strength for their home life. Overall, the employees agreed that they felt happier and more successful with this new arrangement. The Ripple Effect 
This newly improved schedule is being looked into by medical workers of some clinics . That is no surprise figuring how exhausting their job must be. According to The Independent , the six-hour working day will soon be implemented in the whole country. (1) 6 Hour Day for America? 
For most employees who have the 9 to 5 shift, not all of that time is optimized for working. According to studies from The Atlantic , an estimated 1.5 to 3 hours per day is used for online shopping, checking social media and emails, personal phone calls, and chatting with colleagues. It seems that the average employee works a solid six hours anyway, but without the benefits of enjoying free time and rest. A shortened work day means less stress, and we all know how important that is for our health. (2) We would all appreciate a shorter work day, but most of us are not moving to Sweden, and no one should hold their breath for this new schedule to come to their office anytime soon.

Occasionally, a bit of truth escapes… 

From Greg Hunter, USAWatchdog : 
Boston University Economics Professor Laurence Kotlikoff says, “ So, if you put everything on the books, we’re broke, and we’ve been printing money out the wazoo since 2007 to pay Congress’s bills. That’s the truth about quantitative easing. We need to have somebody who knows what’s going on in the big picture here and has a game plan to get rid of this fiscal gap, and do it without total chaos. If we leave things the way they are, people will view the country as leaderless fundamentally and printing money to pay its bills. 
Then, the expectation will occur, and that’s going to raise rates, and that’s going to drop bond prices, and that will sink the banks, and, yes, you can have another great recession like Bill Gross is referencing (bond super nova). I’ve been saying this for decades. The time for the last straw to drop on the camel’s back, and when it’s going to drop that camel is hard to say. If you look at the fundamentals, and the fundamentals look like that of an emerging country, we are the most indebted developed country relative to GDP of any country around. 
We are in worse shape, I believe, than Russia or Greece, and far worse shape than Italy . ” On Sale At SD Bullion… This Week Only…"

"NATO forces Russia to take retaliatory moves 02.11.2016 Russia is forced to take defensive measures against the backdrop of NATO's increasing activities on Russia's western borders, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu said, speaking at a meeting of the joint board of the military departments of Russia and Belarus, RIA Novosti reports. At the July summit in Warsaw, NATO member countries agreed to build up military forces in Eastern Europe. Four multinational battalions are to be deployed in the Baltic States and Poland in 2017. To crown it all, NATO officials intend to strengthen the presence of the alliance in the Black Sea region. All these actions are being made in response to Russia's alleged threat, NATO officials say. However, Russian officials, including President Putin, have repeatedly stated that Russia would never attack any NATO country. At the same time, they added, Russia would not simply sit and watch NATO increasing its military presence near Russia's borders. Print version Font Size ""On western borders of the Unified State (Russia and Belarus - ed.), the United States and other NATO members have been building up their offensive potential by opening new bases and developing military infrastructure. There are continued attempts to impose the will of NATO members on other countries by economic and political dictatorship, as well as by military force. The information warfare is being conducted openly,"" Shoygu said.These actions, the Defense Minister said, undermine the strategic stability and force Russia to take retaliatory measures. The high level of cooperation with Belarus makes it possible to successfully address issues of strengthening the defense capacity of the Unified State, he added. ""This approach is especially relevant now, when international mechanisms designed to resolve critical situations are stalled, and hotspots of tensions have neared our borders,"" Defense Minister Shoygu said. Also read: Russia prepares nuclear surprise for NATO According to him, the military cooperation between Russia and Belarus has been developing actively. In September of 2017, Russia and Belarus are to conduct strategic military exercises ""Zapad-2017"" that will become a ""major joint training event for our armed forces in 2017,"" said Shoygu.In addition, the Defense Minister said that Russia and Belarus pay great attention to the implementation of the agreement on the joint protection of borders and the creation of the joint regional air defense system. In 2016, Russian companies have completed capital repairs of the S-300PS anti-aircraft missile systems that Belarus received from Russia at no cost.

"Bizarre! Drone Records Speeding UFO Over Trees Please scroll down for video 
POSSIBLE UFO SIGHTING? Man sees 'weirdest thing EVER' while filming fall leaves. 
A Parkland County, Alberta, Canada resident has spotted what he believes are flying objects, orbs, and discs while operating a drone camera. The unnamed man was filming at Hasse Lake when he noticed this odd objects zooming through his frame while shooting footage of the fall foliage. The video, recorded with a Phantom3P drone, was sent to the MUTUAL UFO Network (MUFON). The man stated that it was ""the weirdest thing"" he has ever recorded. 
The odd object was not noticed until the drone operator viewed the video at home. He was operating the drone from 500 meters away and did not physically see the weird shapes. The home video shows a collection of white spheres and one darker object that appears as a disc . 
The object zoomed past the drone, swerved to the left and then vanished. It had to be moving at incredible speeds, as his camera was recording at 60 frames per second. The objects appear as a blur when a frame is paused. The man at first thought they must be birds, but then noticed birds in the frame that do not look anything like the objects. 
The man, who has experience recording over 100 other drone videos, has never recorded anything like this. MUFON is currently investigating the case.

Do you remember that scene in the old Frankenstein movie when the villagers descended on the castle with burning stakes and pitchforks? The hounds were baying, people were shouting incoherently, and ignorant, fearful villagers watched the whole thing? 
Listen in particular to the speech at the beginning of this. That’s about what the person leading the charge against James Comey is saying. 
That’s pretty much what is happening to FBI Director James Comey, who is in for a bumpy, maybe even death-defying, ride after i nforming Congress that an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server debacle was being reopened, against the advice of Loretta Lynch , Attorney General. 
According to Harry Reid, a US Senator and one of the head honchos of the Democratic Party, James Comey “may” have broken the law by announcing that emails on devices associated with Hillary Clinton are under renewed investigation. 
He’s referring to the Hatch Act, a law passed in 1939. It was officially called “An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities” and was adopted to prohibit executive branch federal employees (except the President and Vice President) from engaging in certain political activities, such as: using their “official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election”; soliciting, accepting, or receiving political campaign contributions from any person; running “for election to a partisan political office”; soliciting or discouraging participation in political activity of any person who either has an application for a grant, contract, or other status pending before the employing agency or is the subject of an ongoing audit, investigation, or enforcement action by the employing agency; engaging in partisan political activity on official duty time; on federal property; while wearing a uniform or insignia identifying them as federal officials or employees; or while using a government vehicle. ( source ) 
Will he be investigated for exposing a potential crime or will he be investigated for the timing of exposing a potential crime? It seems to me that keeping his mouth shut could also be in violation of the act – if he knew something and did not disclose it, wouldn’t that also affect the outcome of the election? The other villagers are joining in. 
Reid isn’t alone in the monster hunt. He’s joined by some other villagers with torches, pitchforks, and hounds too. 
Take former Attorney General Eric Holder, for example. In a letter to the Clinton campaign, he wrote: 
Many of us have worked with Director Comey; all of us respect him. But his unprecedented decision to publicly comment on evidence in what may be an ongoing inquiry just eleven days before a presidential election leaves us both astonished and perplexed. 
We cannot recall a prior instance where a senior Justice Department official—Republican or Democrat—has, on the eve of a major election, issued a public statement where the mere disclosure of information may impact the election’s outcome, yet the official acknowledges the information to be examined may not be significant or new.” ( source ) 
Perhaps Comey’s decision had something to do with the fact that, as Zero Hedge reported , the DoJ stifled an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation donating money to the political campaign of the wife of an FBI investigator. (I know, it’s sort of like my brother’s sister’s cousin’s husband’s uncle.”) 
Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota Law School professor and the chief White House ethics lawyer for a couple of years during the Bush Administration, wrote an op-ed for the New York Times . He said he’s filing a complaint. 
The F.B.I.’s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election.< Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment. That is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I spent much of my career working on government and lawyers’ ethics, including as the chief White House ethics lawyer for George W. Bush. I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. ( Source ) The Mainstream Media (MSM) will not be kind to Comey. 
Of course, when are they ever kind to people who oppose the Clinton Monarchy? The so-called journalists have armed up with self-righteousness and propagandist pitchforks. 
Here are some related headlines: In Releasing Email News, FBI Director Ignored Justice Department Advice, Tradition – Slate FBI’s James Comey under fire after jolting presidential race – MSNBC Harry Reid: FBI Director James Comey might have broken federal law – Washington Times Clinton Allies Target Comey as Probe Scrambles Campaign – Bloomberg Basically Everybody Thinks James Comey Has F***ed Up – Mother Jones 
And of course, everyone knows how much I love (cough) Huffington Post , which was a trove of ridiculous headlines like: Former Attorney General Eric Holder: FBI Director James Comey ‘Violated’ Justice Department Policies Harry Reid Blasts FBI Director James Comey Over Handling Of Clinton Email Probe First Poll Since James Comey Announcement Shows No Effect On Hillary Clinton — Yet Dozens Of Former Federal Prosecutors Sign Open Letter Criticizing James Comey James Comey Just Unmasked Himself The director of the FBI is between a rock and a hard place. 
If he had said nothing, he would have been pilloried for remaining silent. Today he is being pilloried because he did. 
The man had a stack of resignation letters on his desk from angry FBI agents who knew what was going on. Comey was not alone in the belief that something had to be done to allow the American people to know who they are actually voting for. He’s just the one who is taking the hit for it. 
A leaked memo to FBI employees probably gives the best picture of Comey’s mindset when he made the decision to put himself in the line of fire. 
In a memo explaining his decision to FBI employees soon after he sent his letter to Congress, Comey said he felt “an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.” He admitted that he broke with custom in alerting lawmakers that the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server was being reopened because of its political sensitivity. 
He further explained to FBI employees that “Of course we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed . I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” 
…“At the same time, however, given that we do not know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression,” Comey’s letter continued. “In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter, and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it.” ( source ) 
He is in a lose-lose situation, and I’m sure he knew this. It seems to me that knowing he’s going to be dead the ex-director of the FBI sooner rather than later, he has done what he believes is the right thing. 
Personally, I can’t fault Comey for doing what he did. Maybe he was trying to undo the wrong he did in letting her off in the first place. He’s taking one for the team and most likely sacrificing his career – if not also his life – by taking the action that he took, considering how things tend to go for people who run afoul of the Clintons . It’s anyone’s guess what will happen between now and November 8th. 
Grab some popcorn, my friends. We’re in for an eventful week.

"By Wes Williams Election 2016 , Miscellaneous , Politics , Videos October 28, 2016 ‘I Could Sue You’: Trump’s Spokeswoman Slanders Angela Rye On Live TV – Gets Epic Smack Down (VIDEO)   
Over the past few months, the on-air battles at CNN between Trump’s dumb-as-a-stump surrogate Katrina Pierson and liberal commentator Angela Rye have become legendary. On Friday morning the two put on the gloves to go another round. 
The conversation starts out innocently enough, with a discussion about new economic numbers that show the economy is growing and getting stronger. Great news for Americans — except those like Donald Trump, who are looking to benefit politically from the lie that record numbers of people are suffering. Then host Carol Costello plays a clip of Trump telling an Ohio rally that he wants to do something about the inner city “ghettos.” She observes to Pierson that many black Americans would observe that Trump is not looking at “the whole of the black population.” 
Pierson responds that some members of the black community have been consulting with Trump about the problem. The look on Rye’s face when she says that is classic. When she gets a chance to respond, she says, 
“I think it’s really important that when we have conversations like this they’re rooted in facts. Let’s talk about what Donald Trump could be saying to black people that would resonate and be based in truth.” 
Rye goes on to explain how people like Trump, who have access to capital, don’t seem to appreciate that everyone can’t get their hands on money to improve their lives. Then she talks about Trump’s history as a real estate mogul, who has actually contributed to the creation of the “ghettos” which he now says he wants to fix. 
Pierson responds that Trump has worked with members of the black community, including Jesse Jackson, to help members of the black community create and build businesses. That promotes a hearty laugh from Rye. Costello notes that Rye was a former director of the Congressional Black Caucus, as she asks her to respond. Pierson cuts in, remarking “And [she] ran it [the CBC] into the ground.” At that point, the two women drop all pretense of liking each other and the battle is on. Rye unloads on Pierson with a barrage of facts that her poor little Trump-addled brain was probably having difficulty processing. And when Costello tries to rein her in, Rye hits Pierson with a comment right out of Trump’s playbook. Referring to the charge she “ran the CBC into the ground,” Rye says: 
“That’s slander. I could sue you, Katrina!” 
Here’s the latest round in the Rye-Pierson war of words, via YouTube:

Back in the 1990’s George Soros helped to nearly destroy the Russian economy. So, last year, this grand billionaire was banned from Russia. But, that’s not all. George Soros is now a wanted man in Russia and his organizations are considered as a “threat to Russian national security”. 
From Political Reviewer: 
Matt Taibbi of the Rolling Stone said of Goldman Sachs six years ago: 
“The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it’s everywhere. The world’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. 
“In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Who’s Who of Goldman Sachs graduates.” 
Obviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs. Phil Butler puts it well when he says: “George Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, it’s a safe bet he’s had a hand in it.”

In the following video, billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, his relationship with Bill Clinton, Alan Dershowitz, Prince Andrew and other famous names and their connection to a high-level sex scandal is exposed by Conchita and Cristina Sarnoff. The video (below) also looks at slavery and human sex trafficking in the modern world — and more. Lawyers for convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein touted his close relationship with Bill Clinton and also claimed in a 2007 letter to the Florida State Attorney’s office, that he helped start the Clinton’s family foundation. ( Source ) American Patriot reports: Jeffrey Epstein, the “billionaire pedophile” who was accused of keeping under aged girls as sex slaves on his private island, was long known to be friendly with former President Bill Clinton. The extent of that relationship, however, has never been made clear. But new records indicate the former leader of the free world was much cozier with Epstein than originally known. All aboard the ‘Lolita Express’: Flight logs reveal the many trips Bill Clinton and Alan Dershowitz took on pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s private jet with anonymous women Flight logs for Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane dubbed the ‘Lolita Express’ were published for the first time on Thursday They show that former President Bill Clinton boarded the plane with women believed to have been involved in creating underage sex slave ring Alleged victim Virginia Roberts says she was recruited as a slave when she was 15, and that she was forced to have sex with both Prince Andrew and Harvard law profession Alan Dershowitz The latter, she says, molested her mid-flight on the private jet Both the Duke of York and Dershowitz have fiercely denied their involvement in the ring. Records obtained by Fox News show that Clinton “was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the ‘Lolita Express’– even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights.” Original reports had Clinton on Epstein’s personal 727 only 11 times, however the flight logs obtained by Fox have him flying more than twice that amount. Fox News reports: “Bill Clinton… associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile,” said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called “TrafficKing.”“Why would a former president associate with a man like that?” (…) Official flight logs filed with the Federal Aviation Administration show Clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as 10 U.S. Secret Service agents. However, on a five-leg Asia trip between May 22 and May 25, 2002, not a single Secret Service agent is listed. The U.S. Secret Service has declined to answer multiple Freedom of Information Act requests filed by FoxNews.com seeking information on these trips. Clinton would have been required to file a form to dismiss the agent detail, a former Secret Service agent told FoxNews.com.

Most people in the U.S. first heard of Zika virus about a year ago. It was October 2015 when officials in Brazil reported a possible association between infection with Zika virus and the birth defect microcephaly. 
The virus, however, was first identified in Uganda in 1947, in monkeys. Several years later, in 1952, Zika virus was found in humans in the same area as well as in the United Republic of Tanzania. Outbreaks have occurred ever since, although infections in humans were limited to Africa and Asia. 
The year 2007 marked the first large Zika virus outbreak, which took place on the remote Island of Yap, a tiny island in the Federated States of Micronesia. Then, in July 2015, Brazil reported Zika virus infection appeared to be linked to the autoimmune disease Guillain-Barré syndrome. 
Zika virus is transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, although it is sexually transmitted as well. 
It has since spread to a small area of the U.S. (southern Florida), but fewer than 1,000 U.S. pregnant women have lab evidence of Zika infection (this includes not only locally transmitted cases but also those that occurred via sexual contact). In other words, it’s extremely rare. 
Further, many questions remain about its risks. While the World Health Organization (WHO) says there is a “scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome,” [1] other experts have questioned this link. 
Despite the many unanswered questions, efforts are underway to eradicate the disease, including by releasing controversial man-made and genetically engineered (GE) mosquitoes, with largely unknown effects to the environment. Army of Man-Made Mosquitoes to Be Released in South America 
Scientists are planning to release millions of man-made mosquitoes in Brazil and Colombia in 2017. 
The $18-million project, funded in part by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , involves mosquitoes that have been infected with Wolbachia bacteria, which stops viruses from growing inside the mosquito and therefore from being transmitted between people. 
The Eliminate Dengue research program, which has been working to develop such mosquitoes for a decade, claims the method is “self-sustaining and has the potential to transform the fight against life-threatening viral disease.” 
The altered mosquitoes have been tested in open trials in dengue-affected communities since 2011, but not yet on the scale expected in Brazil and Colombia. The mosquitoes are expected to be released in large, heavily populated urban areas. 
The mosquitoes are described as a refinement of a natural method, as Wolbachia bacteria is present in about 60 percent of insect species, including some mosquitoes. However, it is not naturally occurring in Aedes mosquitoes. 
It took decades for researchers just to figure out how to introduce Wolbachia into Aedes mosquito eggs, but once they did they started experimenting with releasing them into the wild. Field tests suggest the bacteria spread to the vast majority of local mosquitoes, and as Eliminate Dengue said, is a “self-sustaining” system. 
That’s both the point and the problem. Other experimental GE mosquitoes have been genetically engineered to die in the absence of the antibiotic tetracycline (which is introduced in the lab in order to keep them alive long enough to breed). 
They were designed this way assuming they would not have access to that drug in the wild, a failsafe (though not a perfect one, especially since antibiotics are now showing up in waterways) to ensure that the GE insects could theoretically be removed from the environment. 
In the case of the Wolbachia mosquitoes, once they’re released (and they already have been), there’s no stopping them from mingling with wild mosquitoes. While this may help to reduce the spread of certain viruses (although this remains to be seen), it may also have other unintended, as yet unknown consequences. GE Mosquitoes Aim to Wipe Out Mosquito Populations 
Eliminate Dengue’s Wolbachia mosquitoes are only one variety of GE mosquito now circulating the globe. 
Biotech company Oxitec has created its own variety, which has been genetically engineered to carry a “genetic kill switch,” such that when they mate with wild female mosquitoes, their offspring inherits the lethal gene and cannot survive. [2] 
To achieve this feat, Oxitec inserted protein fragments from the herpes virus, E. coli bacteria, coral and cabbage into the insects. Millions have already been experimentally released in Brazil, Panama and the Cayman Islands, and the GE mosquitoes have proven lethal to native mosquito populations. 
In the Cayman Islands, for instance, 96 percent of native mosquitoes were suppressed after more than 3 million GE mosquitoes were released in the area, with similar results reported in Brazil. [3] 
Oxitec, in partnership with the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (FKMCD), also has plans to release the GE mosquitoes, which go by the name of OX513A, in Key Haven, Florida, an island of the Florida Keys located about one mile east of Key West. 
Residents, however, are not overly keen on being guinea pigs in this experiment. A vote is expected November 2016 to determine if the GE insects will be released. Adding to the controversy of releasing GE creatures of any kind into the environment are the unknown consequences of wiping out mosquito populations. 
While they’re primarily viewed as a nuisance and vector for deadly diseases like malaria, there may be “undesirable side effects” of eradicating them entirely, according to Florida University entomologist Phil Lounibos. BBC News reported: [4] 
… [Lounibos] says mosquitoes, which mostly feed on plant nectar, are important pollinators. They are also a food source for birds and bats while their young — as larvae — are consumed by fish and frogs. This could have an effect further up and down the food chain. 
… He warns that mosquitoes could be replaced by an insect ‘equally, or more, undesirable from a public health viewpoint.’ Its replacement could even conceivably spread diseases further and faster than mosquitoes today. Gene-Drive Mosquitoes Are Coming 
Gene-drive technology is incredibly controversial because it gives scientists the ability to control and potentially quickly eradicate entire populations of species. The technology allows a certain gene to spread to 99 percent of offspring instead of the typical 50 percent. 
Gene-editing tools like Crispr have made the use of gene-drive technology a reality. “By encoding the Crispr editing system itself into an organism’s DNA, scientists can cause a desired edit to reoccur in each generation, “driving” the trait through the wild population,” the New York Times explained. [5] 
At Imperial College London, for instance, a gene was created to cause female mosquitoes to become sterile. With gene-drive technology, the gene could cause mosquitoes in the wild to become extinct, fast. According to MIT Technology Review: [6] 
A gene drive is an artificial ‘selfish’ gene capable of forcing itself into 99 percent of an organism’s offspring instead of the usual half. 
And because this particular gene causes female mosquitoes to become sterile, within about 11 generations—or in about one year—its spread would doom any population of mosquitoes. 
If released into the field, the technology could bring about the extinction of malaria mosquitoes and, possibly, cease transmission of the disease. 
Earlier this year, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, the advisory group for the U.S. government on scientific matters, endorsed continued research on gene-drive technology, [7] even though the risks are immense. What Are the Real Risks of Zika Virus? 
We know there are risks of releasing man-made and GE organisms into the environment. The risks of Zika virus remain unknown, however. Chris Barker, a mosquito-borne virus researcher at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, told WebMD: [8] 
I think the risk for Zika actually setting up transmission cycles that become established in the continental U.S. is near zero. 
Barker expects Zika to go the way of other tropical diseases spread by mosquitoes, such as denguepop fever and chikungunya, in the U.S. with perhaps small clusters of outbreaks in southern states and little activity elsewhere. The rising panic of Zika is reminiscent of many past diseases that failed to cause the devastation health officials warned of. Remember SARs, bird flu, swine flu and Ebola ? Or even the measles “outbreak” in 2015? 
There was widespread fear, outrage and panic that the disease would sweep across the U.S., affecting populations from border to border. Calls for experimental drugs and vaccines were made and millions, if not billions, of dollars were spent. And for what? In most cases, the diseases fizzled out on their own, exacting a far less sensational health toll than the media and, often, the government had you believe. 
As reported by PRI, Zika’s million-dollar question is, where are the birth defects? Perhaps that question should be answered before man-made and GE mosquitoes are introduced into the environment, possibly permanently. PRI continued: [9] 
Tens of thousands of Zika cases have been confirmed or suspected in countries like Colombia, Venezuela and Nicaragua since late 2015. The infected have included thousands of pregnant women. But those infections have not led to a dramatic rise in reported birth defects like microcephaly, in which a baby develops an abnormally small head and brain. 
This is confounding to researchers … ‘Researchers are absolutely curious,’ said Julie Fischer, co-director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University. “It’s an enormous relief that the surge in microcephaly cases that was first noticed in northern Brazil has not spread everywhere that the Zika virus has been detected.’

Jonathan Turley – It appears that that “ basket of deplorables ” was a bit larger than Hillary Clinton expected. I was up to 4 am at Fox participating in the coverage of the election from New York. This was my fourth such presidential election as part a media team and it was fascinating to watch [results] unfold at the campaign headquarters at Fox. 
History will judge the decisions of Democrats leaders in this election. As I have previously written, the Democratic National Committee and establishment (including allies in the media) did everything they could to engineer the election of Hillary Clinton. While they had an extremely popular candidate in Bernie Sanders as well as Vice President Joe Biden, they insisted on advancing Clinton despite her being deeply disliked and the ultimate symbol of the establishment that the public was rallying against. 
As the close race indicated, the selection of a Sanders or Biden would have likely produced a sweep of both the White House and the Senate for the Democrats. Instead, they lost them both by forcing voters to vote for someone with record negatives. 
Voters were clear that they did not want Clinton, but the Democrats assumed that the “lesser of two evils” approach would again prevail. They were wrong. Many people voted for third party candidates and many people on the fence refused to pick the candidate most associated with the establishment and the status quo. 
I expect that history will judge the work of figures like Debbie Wasserman-Shultz and Donna Brazile harshly in the roles that they played and more generally in the failure of Democratic leaders to heed the clear demand from voters for a change in leadership. Hillary Clinton was a talented and historic nominee. However, she was also the very symbol of the establishment and heavily laden with the type of associations that the public was clearly reacting against. 
The wins in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania shows precisely how reckless and cynical the DNC strategy proved to be. Clinton won only 18 states and the District of Columbia, though it did earn her 242 electoral votes. Now for the first time in decades, the Democrats have handed a Republican president both houses of Congress. They solved gridlock but not in the way that they had hoped. 
I was astonished to see Clinton decline to speak to her supporters who had wait so loyally at their campaign headquarters. While she did concede over the telephone to Trump, I thought it was bad form not to come down to the headquarters and address the nation and her supporters. They worked incredibly hard and the loss was a terrible blow for them. They deserved better in my view and I felt truly sorry for both their disappointment and effective abandonment at that moment. 
Looking at the results coming into the headquarters, it was clear that no further “counting” would change the result as Clinton’s telephone call affirmed a short while later. It is the final obligation of a candidate in a presidential campaign to be with your supporters and show the nation that the transition of power would proceed, as it always has, in an orderly fashion. It was highly ironic given the well-founded criticism of the statement of Trump that he might not accept the results of the election — a view driven home by Chris Wallace (who was the gold standard for moderators in these election debates). 
The greatest loser in this election was the mainstream media. As I previously discussed , I believe that Trump did bring much of the negative coverage on himself. However, I saw many journalists discard any semblance of neutrality in their coverage, as vividly shown in Wikileaks emails of coordination with the Clinton campaign. The priority for the media should be a serious reexamination of its coverage in this election. 
In the end, the public wanted change and they got it. The fact is that many of the public has long felt that they no longer controlled their government and they were right. That is what makes this so revolutionary and transformative for American politics. Whatever a Trump Administration may hold, it will be shock to the system and that is precisely what tens of millions of Americans wanted. SF Source Jonathan Turley  "

For like the eleventy-billionth time, Sarah Palin posted a broken link to a Facebook post on Twitter Sunday. Now, at first glance her months of posting dead links and not figuring out how to fix the problem might seem moderately stupid — until you see the content of the actual post on the half-term, half-wit former Governor of Alaska’s Facebook timeline. 
Referencing Clinton’s recent, mundane campaign stop at a bar, Palin — who regularly appears to be heavily intoxicated whenever she has a camera in front of her and was involved in a drunken hillbilly brawl in 2014 — quipped, “she’s gonna drive us all to drink.” 
Thinking she is clever, she then adds that Clinton should have been “thinking Sam Adams” rather than “drinking Sam Adams.”
