"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP)  —   Kemba Walker scored 29 points to help Charlotte overcome Russell Westbrook’s sixth straight   to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder   on Sunday. [Westbrook finished with 40 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. It was Westbrook’s 40th   of the season, putting him one behind Oscar Robertson’s NBA record of 41, set during the   season. It was Westbrook’s first career   against Charlotte.  Frank Kaminsky had 18 points and Michael   added 16 for Charlotte, which entered the day in 10th place in the East, two games behind Chicago, Indiana and Miami, who were tied for seventh. Walker went 6 of 12 from   range. It was the 14th time this season Walker hit five or more   in a game. Charlotte had 18 steals against Oklahoma City, the most in a   game for the Hornets since Nov. 23, 2012, against Atlanta. The Hornets scored 35 points off 24 Oklahoma City turnovers. Charlotte seized control with a   run to open the second half, as the Thunder missed their first seven shots after halftime, allowing the Hornets to build a   lead. Westbrook ended Oklahoma City’s scoring drought at the 6:24 mark and the Thunder closed within 12 points twice early in the fourth quarter, but former Thunder guard Jeremy Lamb scored nine points in a   run by Charlotte that made it   with 7:21 left. An   spurt by Oklahoma City, capped by a layup by Andre Roberson, got the Thunder within   with 4:37 left but a   play by Cody Zeller keyed Charlotte. Oklahoma City shot out to a   lead, but the Hornets used a   run to go up   early in the second quarter. The Thunder pulled within   but Charlotte answered with a   run to build a   lead before Westbrook almost   cut the gap to   by halftime.  : Hornets: Walker had four steals, moving him past 600 for his career. He’s the fourth Hornets player to reach that number, joining Muggsy Bogues, Gerald Wallace and Dell Curry.   …     Walker’s 229   this season are the   in a single season in Charlotte franchise history. Jason Richardson had 243 in  .   …     Charlotte, which entered the game averaging the fewest turnovers in the NBA (11. 5 per game) had 18 on Sunday.   …     Lamb scored 13 points against his former team. Thunder: Taj Gibson returned to the starting lineup after missing Friday’s game against San Antonio due to illness, but scored only four points in 13 minutes.   …     Westbrook has 77 career    —   fifth on the NBA’s   list, one behind Wilt Chamberlain.   …     To clinch a season   Westbrook needs 11 rebounds and 29 assists over the Thunder’s final six games.   …     Chicago is the only team against which Westbrook hasn’t recorded a   during his career. UP NEXT: Hornets: Will finish a   road trip at Washington on Tuesday before a potentially key home game on Wednesday against Miami. Thunder: Will host Milwaukee on Tuesday to wrap up a   homestand."
"Washington (CNN) The president of Mexico explained Thursday why he invited Donald Trump to visit his country, pitching the trip as a chance to meet with someone important    even if the Republican nominee is widely disliked in the country. ”I was very clear in public and in private to emphasize the fact that in Mexico, we feel offended and hurt by his statements about Mexicans,” Enrique Peña Nieto wrote in an   for his El Universal. ”I expressed that we deserve respect, that we are honest, hardworking people, that we value our families and the culture of effort.” Peña Nieto and Trump met in Mexico City Wednesday on a whirlwind visit ahead of Trump’s major immigration speech in Arizona. In public, Trump and Peña Nieto mostly struck a friendly tone, though acrimony later broke out over whether the pair had discussed Mexican payment for a   border wall, a trademark Trump policy. ”I was also very clear in my conversation with Trump on the border: Mexico will not pay for any wall,” Peña Nieto wrote. Trump has disputed Peña Nieto’s account, and in his speech on Wednesday he declared, ”Mexico will pay for the wall. 100%. They don’t know it yet, but they’re going to pay for the wall.” Earlier on Thursday, Trump shared a video on Instagram of his arrival at the palace by helicopter. ”Thank you to President Enrique Pena Nieto   for the invitation to meet with him in Mexico City, Mexico. Wonderful leadership and high quality people! I look forward to our next meeting. #TrumpTrain #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpPence16” Trump wrote in the post. A Mexican government official and a source close to the Mexican government both tell CNN that the idea for the invitations for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto came from the Finance Ministry. According to the source close to the government, Mexico wants to show it can work with Trump if he wins. Finance Ministry officials hope that having Trump in Mexico will calm down investors who have been fleeing. The Mexican Central Bank registered more than $11 billion in capital outflows in the first half of 2016. The visit was seen as an attempt to prevent the peso from falling. Up to now, when Clinton leads in the polls, the peso strengthens the opposite happens when the polls tighten. According to the Mexican government official, the Foreign Ministry was not aware of the invitations to Trump and Clinton. In fact, Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz and the undersecretary for North America, Paulo Carreño, were in Milwaukee on Tuesday opening the new Mexican Consulate, and she flew back Tuesday night when Trump posted his tweets. Peña Nieto has reiterated that Mexico will work with whoever gets elected."
"Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton repeatedly told the FBI she couldn’t recall key details and events related to classified information procedures, according to notes the bureau released Friday of its July interview with the Democratic presidential nominee, along with a report on its investigation into her private email server.  Clinton told the FBI she ”could not recall any briefing or training by State related to the retention of federal records or handling classified information,” according to the bureau’s notes of their interview with Clinton. The documents indicate Clinton told investigators she either does not ”recall” or ”remember” at least 39 times  —   often in response to questions about process, potential training or the content of specific emails. Much of the report reiterated what FBI Director James Comey testified in open hearings before Congress, including that more than six dozen email chains contained classified information at the time they were sent and that there appeared to have been hacking attempts on her server, though there is no evidence they were successful. Still, the report added fuel to the criticisms of Clinton and the narrative that her team acted ”extremely careless,” as Comey said. GOP nominee Donald Trump and other Republicans have stepped up their attacks connecting the emails to questions over whether Clinton gave preferential treatment to donors to her family’s foundation. The release of the documents Friday comes as Clinton’s lead over Trump has been cut in half since her   bounce last month, according to CNN’s Poll of Polls released Thursday. The bureau is making the information public in response to numerous Freedom of Information Act requests, including from CNN.  ”Today the FBI is releasing a summary of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s July 2, 2016 interview with the FBI concerning allegations that classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on a personal   server she used during her tenure,” the agency said in a statement. ”We also are releasing a factual summary of the FBI’s investigation into this matter.” Presidential campaign ramifications   The publication of the FBI report is likely to give a new burst of political life to the controversy over Clinton’s private server.  The episode plays directly into Republican claims that Clinton is dishonest, abhors transparency and lacks the ethical standards required of someone who sits in the Oval Office. It also allows Trump’s campaign to suggest to voters that they will be setting up a repeat of the cycle of scandals, controversy, and investigations that dragged on through the entire presidency of Bill Clinton and which tainted Hillary Clinton at the same time. ”Hillary Clinton’s answers to the FBI about her private email server defy belief,” Trump said in a statement. ”I was absolutely shocked to see that her answers to the FBI stood in direct contradiction to what she told the American people. After reading these documents, I really don’t understand how she was able to get away from prosecution.” Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, meanwhile, called the release a ”devastating indictment” of Clinton’s honesty and judgment. Clinton’s campaign, however, said it was ”pleased” by the release. ”While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case,” Clinton’s national press secretary Brian Fallon said in a statement.  ’Oh s***’ The FBI report also provided detail on mass deletions of Clinton’s email server by the company maintaining her server, Platte River Networks, after the existence of it came to light.   According to the investigation report, top Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills told a PRN worker whose name was redacted in December 2014 that Clinton wanted her email to only be retained for 60 days, and instructed him to reset the retention policy on her email account. But the individual told the FBI he realized that he had failed to do so until after The New York Times published its bombshell story revealing Clinton’s private server and email use, prompting an ”’oh s***’ moment.” ”In a   FBI interview on May 3, 2016, (name redacted) indicated he believed he had an ’oh s***’ moment and sometime between March   2015, deleted the Clinton archive mailbox from the PRN server and used BleachBit to delete the exported . PST files he had created on the server system containing Clinton’s emails,” the report stated.  The mass deletion occurred after the March 2, 2015, Times story and after a March 3, 2015, preservation order from the House Benghazi Committee to retain and produce documents related to her email accounts. Mills had sent this request to PRN and this individual on March 9, 2015, and under repeat questioning by the FBI, the individual admitted he was aware that the request existed and meant he shouldn’t disturb the files on PRN’s server. Both Mills and Clinton told the FBI they were not aware of the mass deletion that March. Colin Powell, One of the findings revealed in the report is that former Secretary of State Colin Powell ”warned” Clinton that her emails could become government record in 2009. According to the report summarizing the FBI’s investigation, Clinton emailed Powell just after inauguration in 2009 about his use of a BlackBerry as secretary of state.  ”Powell warned Clinton that if it became ’public’ that Clinton had a BlackBerry, and she used it to ’do business,’ her emails could become ’official record( s) and subject to the law,’” the report stated. ”Powell further advised Clinton, ’Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data. ’”  But the FBI said Clinton described her understanding of Powell’s comments as saying that   emails would be official record, adding ”Powell’s comments did not factor into her decision to use a personal email account.” Before it became public, interest in the contents of the report had intensified after it was reported that Clinton told the FBI a conversation with Powell recommending she use private email helped convince her to do so. Powell repudiated the idea that he shares any responsibility for her choice in the following days, however, and Clinton told CNN’s Anderson Cooper last month that she takes full responsibility.  ”I’ve been asked many, many questions in the past year about emails. And what I’ve learned is that when I try to explain what happened it can sound like I’m trying to excuse what I did,” she told CNN. ”And there are no excuses. I want people to know that the decision to have a single   mail account was mine. I take responsibility for it. I’ve apologized for it. I would certainly do differently if I could.” Powell rejects Clinton email defense, Use of mobile devices, The report also described the way Clinton used her BlackBerry mobile devices. Clinton has cited her desire to use a single BlackBerry as part of her motivation to use a personal email address. Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin told the FBI that Clinton often would use a new BlackBerry for a few days before returning to an older model because of her familiarity, according to the report. The FBI found that 13 different mobile devices were used with her two known phone numbers, and thus may have sent emails with her private account. After Clinton switched to a new device, the previous incarnation would often disappear, and a former Bill Clinton aide, Justin Cooper, said he could recall two times he destroyed the old device either by breaking it in half or hitting it with a hammer. The findings also noted that Clinton stored her BlackBerry in a desk drawer in her office, which was not authorized. Her office was in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) and thus the use of mobile devices in the office was prohibited. The former Assistant Secretary of State for State Diplomatic Security Service Eric Boswell told the FBI that he ”never received any complaints about Clinton using her personal BlackBerry inside the SCIF.”  According to Abedin, Cooper and another person whose name was redacted from the report, there were personally owned desktop computers in the SCIFs in Clinton’s homes in Washington and Chappaqua, New York. Clinton had stated to the FBI she did not have a computer of any kind in the SCIFs in her residences. Abedin and Clinton said the former secretary of state did not use a computer and primarily used her BlackBerry or iPad for checking emails. Handing of classified information, The notes revealed that Clinton relied heavily on her staff and aides to determine what was classified information and how it should be handled.  ”Clinton did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system,” the FBI notes said. ”She relied on State official to use their judgment when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address.” Clinton was also asked about the (C) markings within several documents that James Comey testified before Congress represented classified information. The emails that were sent and received from her server containing these markings became the subject of intense debate on the Hill, as her critics seized on them as evidence that she mishandled information. But Clinton told the FBI she was unaware of what the marking meant. ”Clinton stated she did not know and could only speculate it was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order,” the interview notes stated.  The former secretary of state said she did understand when an email was marked ”confidential” at the top, and ”asked the interviewing agents if that was what ’c’ referenced,” according to the notes. The confidential label had been placed there by the FBI after the fact.  She also said she didn’t ”pay attention to the ’level’ of classified information and took all classified information seriously.” The interview also addressed a 2011 email in which Clinton said she hadn’t received talking points from her aide, Jake Sullivan. He responded that there were issues sending the document through secure fax.  ”If they can’t,” Clinton replies, ”turn into nonpaper w no identifying heading and send nonsecure.” That email had been the fuel behind speculation that Cilnton had demanded her aide send classified information through a nonsecure channel by removing markings. But Clinton told the FBI that she understood the request as routine.  ”Clinton thought a ’nonpaper’ was a way to convey the unofficial stance of the US government to a foreign government and believed this practice went back ’200 years,’” she said, according to interview notes. ”When viewing the displayed email, Clinton believed she was asking Sullivan to remove the State letterhead and provide unclassified talking points. Clinton stated she had no intention to remove classification markings.” Fallout from Comey’s remarks, Comey in July took the unprecedented step of announcing in a press conference the FBI’s conclusion that there was not enough evidence to merit a criminal prosecution, before handing over his findings to the Justice Department. Anticipation for FBI’s release on Clinton investigation, The DOJ followed that recommendation and decided no prosecution was merited.  After Comey testified about the decision before Congress, members requested access to his agency’s report. Last month, the bureau gave members of Congress access to the notes, as well as notes from interviews with other Clinton staff and aides, but kept that version of the report classified.  Comey testified that no transcript of the interview exists, only the notes taken on it. Clinton was not under oath.  The FBI’s release Friday did not include the notes of interviews with Clinton’s aides. "
"U. S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw a £700 million investment due to be made in two golf courses he owns in Scotland if British Members of Parliament vote to ban him from the country. [A spokesman for Mr Trump said a ban would send a message to the world that the UK opposes free speech, as it emerged that Muslim, Labour Members of Parliament were leading the charge to have Mr. Trump banned.  On Tuesday a House of Commons committee announced that Parliament will debate later this month a petition calling for Mr Trump to be barred entry to the UK. The petition was launched by a     activist in Scotland following remarks made by Mr Trump in which he called for a moratorium on Muslims entering the U. S. until the threat of Islamic extremism is better understood, The Telegraph has reported. In response, The Trump Organisation has issued a statement detailing plans for a £200 million investment in their Turnberry golf course in South Ayrshire, and a further £500 million in Trump International Golf Links near Aberdeen, warning that any moves to block Mr Trump from travelling to the UK would “immediately end these and all future investments we are currently contemplating in the United Kingdom”. The statement continued: “Westminster would create a dangerous precedent and send a terrible message to the world that the United Kingdom opposes free speech and has no interest in attracting inward investment. “This would also alienate the many millions of United States citizens who wholeheartedly support Mr Trump and have made him the forerunner by far in the 2016 presidential election. “Many people now agree with Mr Trump that there is a serious problem that must be resolved. This can only be achieved if we are willing discuss these tough issues openly and honestly. ” The petition, which has gained more than 570, 000 signatures in less than one month, argued: “The U. K. has banned entry to many individuals for hate speech. The same principles should apply to everyone who wishes to enter the U. K. ” In its official response to the petition, the government highlighted both the Prime Minister David Cameron’s, and Home Secretary Theresa May’s opposition to Mr Trumps remarks, in particular Ms May’s comment that Trumps words had been “divisive, unhelpful and wrong. ” However, the government added “Exclusion powers are very serious and are not used lightly. ”"
"Hillary Clinton’s running mate Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) said in 2002 that politicians facing true allegations of sexual harassment should resign, suggesting Bill Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky is “not appropriate conduct” and “beneath the dignity of the office. ”[Kaine’s comments, which were published in the Richmond   the Washington Post and the Associated Press, came in 2002 when the Virginia Speaker of the House Vance Wilkins faced a sex scandal, according to the Daily Beast.  “When I read it this morning, my reaction was the same I had when I read about the   affair: this is not appropriate conduct. It’s beneath the dignity of the office,” Kaine stated, according to an Associated Press story about Wilkins’ scandal, which was published on June 8, 2002. A Washington Post article published that day also highlighted Kaine’s criticism of Clinton: Lt. Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) who may face [state Attorney General Jerry] Kilgore in the 2005 governor’s race, likened the matter to the sexual scandal of President Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, saying, “If the allegations are true, he ought to resign. ” “Somebody in public life shouldn’t behave that way toward women,” Kaine said. “It’s tawdry. It’s not the leadership that Virginia should have. ” The Richmond   report paralleled the Washington Post and Associated Press. “If the allegations are true, he should definitely resign,” Kaine stated, reported the Richmond   at the time, noting Kaine added that “he held the same view about President Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. ” “That is an intolerable way to treat women and it’s not something that the state should be dragged through,” Kaine jabbed. Spokesperson for Kaine, Amy Dudley, told the Daily Beast that right now Kaine is focused on the future. “As the Associated Press reported at the time, Kaine characterized President Clinton’s actions as ‘not appropriate’ conduct, but he had previously been on record criticizing the impeachment effort,” Dudley stated. “He believes this election is about Hillary Clinton’s vision to make historic investments to create good paying jobs, make college debt free and build an economy that works for everyone, not   personal issues from the distant past. ”"
"Following last month’s earthquake in Ecuador, Rep. Luis Gutiérrez ( ) is again calling on the Obama administration to shield potentially hundreds of thousands of Ecuadorians from deportation. [“It has already taken longer than it should have to grant [Temporary Protected Status]  —   more than a month since the terrible earthquakes rocked Ecuador,” Gutiérrez said Monday. “I am asking [Homeland Security Sec. Jeh Johnson] to take action as quickly as possible to lift the uncertainty facing Ecuadorians in the U. S. who might be deported. ”  Temporary Protected Status is an immigration benefit granted to nationals of foreign countries that have experienced a disaster or conflict that makes it too dangerous for a safe return home. According to Gutierrez, the earthquake that took place in Ecuador on April 16 meets the level of disaster worthy of applying TPS to Ecuadorians currently in the U. S. illegally or on    visas. “The situation in Ecuador is very serious and TPS allows Ecuadorians to help support the recovery effort through their remittances and TPS delays deportations until after the country is stable enough to accept returning nationals,” he added. Last week, the government of Ecuador formally requested that the U. S. grant TPS to Ecuadorians in the U. S. according to TeleSur. It reports there are currently some 200, 000 Ecuadorians living in the U. S. illegally  —   out of an estimated one million total Ecuadorians in the U. S. Immigration hawks have criticized TPS as a de facto amnesty that rarely expires, even after the conflict or disaster has been resolved. “TPS is what you might call green    —   it provides the illegal immigrants (and legal tourists, students, et al. whose visas are expiring) a work permit, Social Security number, driver’s license, and access to certain welfare benefits, but not an immediate path to citizenship. Obama’s lawless DACA and DAPA amnesties were modeled on TPS,” Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, commented at National Review last month. Gutiérrez formally requested the extension of TPS to citizens of Ecuador in a letter to President Obama on April 25."
"With the Iowa caucuses just two and half weeks away, Hillary Clinton suddenly finds herself in a   race against Vermont Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. [According to polling in Iowa and New Hampshire, Hillary is now a slight underdog in the first two contests of the Democrat nomination battle.  Hillary’s current campaign struggles inevitably invite comparisons with the 2008 campaign, when she was the presumptive frontrunner for the entire campaign until votes started to be cast. In one important way, though, her campaign is doing far worse today than it was in 2008. Hillary’s national lead, and her standing in the first two voting states, is worse today than it was at a similar point in 2008. At this point in 2008, Hillary still enjoyed a 20 point lead against her rivals for the nomination in national polls. Today, however, her lead over Socialist Sanders is just 8 points in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls. It should be noted that Hillary’s nearly 20 point lead in 2008 at this point in time was against TWO credible rivals, Sens. Barack Obama and John Edwards. Today, Hillary’s only rival for the nomination is Sanders. Yet, she enjoys less than half the polling advantage. Even with the vote split three ways in 2008, she enjoyed a stronger base of support in absolute terms than she does today against a single rival. In other words, Hillary today is up against an historic mathematical conundrum. According to national polling at the time, Hillary was in a much stronger position in 2008 than she is today. Even so, within two weeks of that polling lead in 2008 she would be fighting, unsuccessfully, for her political life. The head winds against her are far more powerful this year than they were 8 years ago as well. At an existential level, society has changed and is no longer willing to brush aside her husband’s past transgressions and allegations of sexual abuse against female subordinates. Neither she nor her husband are as effective on the campaign trail as they were in 2008, for the simple reason that both have aged another eight years. More importantly, perhaps, she has a far more questionable record to defend today than she did in 2008. Setting aside questions about the legality of her use of private   accounts as Secretary of State, her handling of the issue has caused a serious erosion in voter’s belief in her honesty. A Hillary victory, at this point, would require voters to elect someone they don’t trust. That is very unlikely. Against these fundamental challenges for Hillary, Bernie Sanders is riding a campaign wave that has grown larger, faster than the one that propelled Barack Obama into the Democrat nomination. It should be remembered that it was only after his win in Iowa that Barack Obama began attracting the size of crowds that Sanders currently draws. Sanders has amassed   donors and donations at a faster pace than Obama in the 2008 campaign. It has long been assumed that Barack Obama himself represented a kind of “perfect storm” that slammed against the Clinton campaign in 2008. Most pundits attributed Obama’s strong   campaign in 2008 to his particular biography and unique rhetorical gifts. The faster, and in some ways more successful, trajectory of the Sanders campaign suggests a more fundamental reasons for Hillary’s fall. The voters simply don’t like her. She is the frontrunner only until any other remotely credible alternative comes along. In 2008, Hillary battled back to a narrow win in New Hampshire after losing the Iowa caucuses. She was able to contest the nomination deep into the primaries, almost up until the Democrat convention before finally conceding defeat. This election, Hillary’s campaign may not last that long.  "
"Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that her statement that Republicans were among her enemies was “tongue in cheek” and that she considers Republicans “worthy adversaries” at Monday’s Democratic presidential town hall on CNN.  Clinton, in response to a question on her calling Republicans enemies, said, “[I]t was kind tongue in cheek. And I consider them worthy adversaries, because they are. They have their set of objectives. We have ours, on the Democratic side. But that’s why I gave you a short overview. I worked with all of them, you know when I’m actually in office, they say really nice things about me. We have a whole, long list of the nice things they say, what a good colleague I am, how easy I am to work with, how willing I am to try to find common ground, then when I run, oh my goodness, it’s just unbelievable. So, I have no problems in saying, yeah, we have political differences, we’re on opposite sides, but, we’re going to work as hard as we can. And here’s what I know about how to get that done. It takes building relationships, and that is one of the hardest things to do in politics, over ideological and partisan lines. So I’m going to be just giving them all bear hugs, whether they like it or not. We’re going to get together, we’re going to talk about about what we can do, maybe we can get something done together. If not, maybe I can find that slice of common ground, to find somebody who will work with me on achieving a goal that we want. So, that’s the way the process should work, constantly looking for ways to make a difference and putting together the coalitions within the Congress to pass laws. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
"From the Washington Post:[A charity affiliated with the Clinton Foundation failed to reveal the identities of its 1, 100 donors, creating a broad exception to the foundation’s promise to disclose funding sources as part of an ethics agreement with the Obama administration.  The number of undisclosed contributors to the charity, the   Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, signals a larger zone of secrecy around foundation donors than was previously known. Details of the organization’s fundraising were disclosed this week by a spokeswoman for the Canadian group’s founder, mining magnate Frank Giustra. The Canadian group has received attention in recent days as a potential avenue for anonymous Clinton Foundation donations from foreign business executives, including some who had interests before the U. S. government while Hillary Rodham Clinton was secretary of state. The partnership, named in part for Bill Clinton, sends much of its money to the New   Clinton Foundation. Two of the partnership’s known donors  —   Giustra and another mining executive, Ian Telfer  —   are featured in the     book “Clinton Cash” for their roles in a series of deals that resulted in Russia controlling many uranium deposits around the world and in the United States.

"As the world awaits Mother Teresa’s canonization Sunday, one mystery remains: why the international Left still harbors such hatred for a diminutive religious sister who spent her entire life serving the poorest of the poor. [After all, with her inexhaustible dedication to alleviating poverty and assisting the needy, Mother Teresa should be an icon of liberals the world over. Instead, we find that the Left showers her not with affection and praise, but with scorn and disdain.  On September 1, The Washington Post published an article titled “Why Mother Teresa Is Still No Saint to Many of Her Critics,” citing harsh condemnations of the nun by Hindu nationalists and cataloguing the complaints lodged against the missionary’s work through the decades. Earlier this year, Salon called Mother Teresa “repugnant,” accusing her of glorifying suffering instead of relieving it. “Judged by any metric of medical standards,” the piece stated, “it is difficult to remember her legacy as anything other than an inefficient, sanctimonious and wholly ideological franchise. ” Last weekend, The New York Times showcased “one of the most vocal critics” of Mother Teresa, an Indian physician named Aroup Chatterjee who has made a career out of casting aspersions on the work of the Albanian nun. Chatterjee calls Teresa’s work “an imperialist venture of the Catholic Church against an Eastern population. ” “I just thought that this myth had to be challenged,” he added. In 1994, Dr. Chatterjee teamed up with professional atheist Christopher Hitchens to produce a documentary trashing Mother Teresa and her missionaries, called “Hell’s Angel. ” Shortly afterward, Hitchens cashed in on Mother Teresa’s immense popularity by writing his own bestselling book excoriating the sister, irreverently titled The Missionary Position. In this “exposé,” Hitchens calls Mother Teresa “a religious fundamentalist, a political operative, a primitive sermonizer, and an accomplice of worldly secular powers,” as well as asserting that the secret ulterior motive behind all her work was “furthering Catholic doctrine. ” So the questions again present themselves: Why so much hatred? Why so much   anger against this woman? Sifting through the literature dedicated to smearing the legacy of Mother Teresa, one discovers that all the arguments against her really boil down to two, which the Left can never forgive: her vocal and intransigent opposition to abortion and her overtly Christian spirituality that moved her to pour herself out for her fellow man. All the other reasons given —  that she provided inferior health care, that she was occasionally irritable with coworkers, that she accepted donations from morally ambiguous characters —  are really just a cover for the two that irked the Left to the point of hysteria. And hysteria it has been. In a noteworthy 1986 essay published by the international abortion giant Planned Parenthood, titled “Mother Teresa, the Woman of My Nightmares,” one gets a taste of the profound odium stirred up by this simple religious sister. “This very successful old and withered person, who doesn’t look in the least like a woman, especially when she raises her clenched fists in prayer, and who, for us, is a very suspect holder of the Nobel Prize,” Planned Parenthood wrote in its official publication Sexualpedagogik, “has become for us the symbol of all that is bad in motherhood and womanhood, an image with which we do not wish to be associated. ” “You, you nightmare of women! You unliberated, enslaved wives, mothers, nuns and aunts, what do you want from us, who have finally decided that we are going to take control of our bodies, our children, and our destiny into our own hands?” it ran. Abortion, in fact, formed the centerpiece of Mother Teresa’s definition of poverty and all that is wrong with the world. The three most public speeches of her career —  her acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize, her Harvard Commencement address, and her words at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D. C. —  all focused on abortion as the greatest social injustice in the world today. For Mother Teresa, the voiceless unborn child was truly the “poorest of the poor,” who deserves our undying respect and protection. In her acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, for instance, she dared to say, “I feel the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a direct war, a direct killing  —   direct murder by the mother herself. ” At the National Prayer Breakfast in 1994, the politically incorrect sister told   Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary that abortion is a “war against the child. ” “And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?” the nun continued. “By abortion, the mother does not learn to love, but kills even her own child to solve her problems,” she said. “Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want. ” But opposition to abortion was not the only crime that earned Mother Teresa the undying ire of the Left. She was also irritatingly  …     religious. Instead of secular philanthropy, she engaged in   Christian charity, picking the dying up off the street and holding them in her arms as they passed away, for the love of God. Mother Teresa was guilty, in fact, of the great modern sin of political incorrectness. She freely and unapologetically invoked her love for Jesus Christ as the reason behind everything she did, a practice that is anathema to a world antiseptically cleansed from the grime of religious piety. “I see Jesus in every human being,” she said. “I say to myself, this is hungry Jesus, I must feed him. This is sick Jesus. This one has leprosy or gangrene I must wash him and tend to him. I serve because I love Jesus. ” Despite her spiritual motivations, however, Mother Teresa was an avowed enemy of proselytism in her work with the poor. She offered love and assistance to all, without ever making conversion a condition or even an aim of her care. “We never try to convert those whom we receive to Christianity,” she said, “but in our work we bear witness to the love of God’s presence, and if Catholics, Protestants, Buddhists, or agnostics become for this better men —  simply better —  we will be satisfied. ” Teresa believed that those who find love find God, and that the best way to bring people to God is by sharing our love with them. “Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier,” she said. “Be the living expression of God’s kindness: kindness in your face, kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile. ” As Pope Francis canonizes Mother Teresa of Calcutta Sunday morning, one group will not be standing by to join the applause: the disaffected Left who cannot forgive the Albanian nun for her deeply Christian charity or her staunch opposition to abortion. Even in this “year of mercy,” some sins can never be forgiven. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter  Follow @tdwilliamsrome"
"MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina  —   GOP frontrunner billionaire Donald Trump and his chief rival for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) will take their battle on the road to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on Saturday at the first day of the Breitbart News Network sponsored South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention. [Trump, who is attending an event with former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown in New Hampshire earlier on Saturday before heading to Myrtle Beach, will speak at 4:30 p. m. Cruz will hit the stage earlier at 2:20 p. m.  Both appeared at the same conference last year before they launched their presidential campaigns, but their speeches here this year will represent the first public battle between the two of them since —  in Trump’s words —  the “bromance” between the two   GOP presidential candidates ended on the debate stage two hours south in Charleston on Thursday evening. Trump has been questioning Cruz over whether the Calgary, Canada, born Senator is a “natural born citizen” —  which the U. S. Constitution requires of presidents —  while Cruz has been fighting Trump over what Cruz says are Trump’s “New York Values. ” Those two major plot lines exploded in Charleston on Thursday at the Fox Business debate as both candidates outshone the rest of the field, most of which are   candidates, as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich all jockeyed for position behind Cruz and Trump. Also on Saturday, their fellow GOP presidential candidate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee will speak 11:20 a. m. and several other major newsmakers including Sen. David Perdue ( ) and Breitbart’s own Peter Schweizer, AWR Hawkins, and Stephen K. Bannon will speak. Schweizer, the author of Clinton Cash, has upended the 2016 presidential race with revelations he made about Democratic frontrunner former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s and her husband former President Bill Clinton’s crony capitalist ties to the world’s financial elite. Hawkins, Breitbart’s Second Amendment correspondent, has been leading the way in coverage of Americans’ right to keep and bear arms —  something President Barack Obama has tried to take away from many Americans with his recent executive gun control actions —  and the focus of that issue when it comes to the future of the U. S. political landscape. Bannon, Breitbart’s Executive Chairman and the host of Breitbart News Daily which airs on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from Monday through Friday from 6 a. m. to 9 a. m. ET, was named the “most dangerous political operative in America” in a recent     profile by Bloomberg Businessweek. The conference lasts three days and on Sunday will see former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum speak at 2:20 p. m. in addition to David Webb from SiriusXM Patriot and Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) —  the congressman behind the successful effort to remove John Boehner as Speaker of the House. Monday will see Dr. Ben Carson and South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson speak. The conference, now several years deep and held again at the Springmaid Beach Resort here, is being live streamed by Ground Floor Video and distributed on Breitbart News Network throughout its entirety. Those who can’t attend in person but want to watch will be able to live stream the event on Breitbart. com. In addition to the live stream, Breitbart News Network and SiriusXM Patriot are bringing Breitbart News Daily, Breitbart News Saturday and Breitbart News Sunday on the road to the convention here in Myrtle Beach for live coverage from the scene. The Saturday show will air live from inside the Convention Center from 10 a. m. to 1 p. m. ET, while the Sunday show will air from 7 p. m. to 10 p. m. ET and the Monday show will air from 6 a. m. to 9 a. m. All three shows will air as scheduled on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125. Also, on Saturday evening from 7:30 p. m. to 10:30 p. m. several of Breitbart’s editors and reporters will be hosting a Breitbart   at the Barrel Bar in Myrtle Beach.

" (CNN) Former President Barack Obama   into public life on Monday in Chicago and, in the process, offered a potent reminder of what a radical change in direction the country took in the 2016 election. Obama sat in the middle of a group of young people    all of whom shared their own personal stories about their involvement in public life and why more people their age didn’t follow their lead. He spoke, briefly, at the start of the event about what drew him into community service and politics    ”this community taught me that ordinary people, when working together, can do extraordinary things”    but spent most of the rest of the event serving as the moderator of the panel. Obama asked questions here and there to prompt answers from the (nervous) panelists and occasionally would interject his own views, particularly about how the   of media consumption had created a culture where no one really listens to each other anymore. But, generally speaking, Obama wasn’t actually talking all that much. And, what he did talk about    the importance of organizing, gerrymandering, the fracturing of the media    weren’t exactly   talking points. It was a professor holding a discussion group with students. Which, of course, makes sense. Obama’s default position is professorial    to the delight of his allies and the anger of his opponents. After almost 100 days of Donald Trump, the contrast could not have been more striking. Trump’s first   months in office have been largely defined by a flair for the dramatic and an absolute conviction that the course he is charting    even if he changes course     is the right one. There is very little in the way of philosophical conversation about what binds us    and ails us    as a country. It’s full speed ahead at all times no BS    or      allowed. That isn’t to say one style of leadership is better than the other (although public polling suggests Trump is significantly less popular at this stage of his   term than Obama was).  It is to say that it’s hard for me to imagine that the American public could have chosen two more opposite people to lead the country in consecutive elections. Some of this has to do with the psychology of the voter. Most people tend to favor a clear change in leadership at the end of one president’s eight years in the White House. They react to the qualities they dislike in the current president and seek out a new candidate who seems to embody the opposite of those traits.  So we went from the brilliant but   Bill Clinton to the solid and steady George W. Bush to the young dynamic leader in Obama. And then to to businessman and political outsider Donald Trump. But this latest change isn’t just par for the course. While Bush clearly represented a break from the negative aspects of the Clinton years, he and his predecessor were still on the same political continuum. Both had been governors. Both had spent years cultivating a political operation. Both were, at their root, orthodox politicians. Trump is not only not an orthodox politician but was elected on his unorthodoxy. Given that, any Trump predecessor would show him as a major departure. But, Obama and Trump share nothing    not background, not political view, not anything    in common. How could the public elect two men in consecutive elections who share so little in their beliefs about what’s wrong with the country and how to fix it? I’m not sure. But my guess is   political polarization coupled with a   truth that many people aren’t entirely sure what they want from their government has a lot to do with it."
" (CNN) Having failed, at least so far, to deliver on his promises on healthcare, a border wall and tax cuts, President Donald Trump ended his first 100 days in office the way they began, with a deeply negative, divisive speech that served as a booster shot for his followers’ rage. Included in the tirade, which he delivered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, were attacks on the press, immigrants and progressives. Once again, he flailed Democrats who ”don’t mind the illegals pouring in, the drugs pouring in. They don’t mind.” He also referred to the members of the media as ”very dishonest people” and ”enemies of the people,” before returning to his diatribe against immigration and the need for a border wall.  All of this was offered in a rambling style worthy of a reality TV star    not the President of the United States.    Of course it was style and not substance that Trump traveled to deliver, and it was style that many came to hear. The Saturday spectacle in this swing state was politics practiced as a dark art, designed to entertain the crowd while distracting from the cruel fact that Trump hasn’t been able to fulfill his campaign pledges.  As so often occurs with Trump, reality took a back seat as he celebrated his 100 day mark. Although empty seats could be seen from the podium where he stood, he announced that attendance ”broke the   record.” He praised the mythological substance called ”clean coal” and falsely claimed that The New York Times had apologized for its coverage of the 2016 election.  The decidedly unpresidential tone of Trump’s address was consistent with his motivation for going to Pennsylvania in the first place. The appearance coincided with the annual White House correspondent’s dinner, which has been a tradition in Washington since the 1930s. The event, essentially a roast of the sitting President and others in the power elite, marks the one night of the year when the powerful agree to accept ridicule and even admit to their own flaws, all in the name of charity and amity.   Trump, whose idea of humor is to mock others, is the first President to skip the dinner since Ronald Reagan was recovering from the bullet wounds he suffered in an assassination attempt. For him, there would be no   acceptance of jibes from comedians and politicians. Instead he chose to alienate the majority of Americans who disapprove of his presidency thus far and rally his supporters with an   tirade. Like a sulking child who hosts a competing party when the other kids gather to celebrate, Trump intended to upstage the WHCD, and to some extent he did. His rally got plenty of TV airtime and was   online. It reminded his supporters that he can be relied upon to stir their resentment. The event also served the President’s ego, bringing an energy and enthusiasm to his face that has been missing ever since that night when he seemed stunned to see that he had gained the White House while losing the popular vote.   Always a man with a chip on his shoulder, Trump has often seemed quite miserable in the office of the President, and it’s easy to imagine him alone in the White House (with his wife Melania living in New York) dialing up old friends to chat as darkness falls on Washington.  Except for being amused by the fact that he can press a button at his desk and suddenly receive a fresh glass of Coke, Trump has appeared quite grumpy as he struggles to get anything significant accomplished. His legislative failures on health care have been matched by multiple defeats in the courts in his effort to ban visitors from several   countries from our shores. Investigations into his team’s connection to Russia continue, and members of his staff make more headlines for their feuds than for their policy agendas. The work product of the Trump administration betrays the malaise gripping the man at the top, who only seems like himself when he’s on stage performing as an angry provocateur. He is, at his core, the personification of the politics of division. This quality was fully established when he declared his run for the presidency and has been his modus operandi ever since. In his most authentic moments as President, most recently in Harrisburg, he has made himself into a riveting but also terrifying spectacle that is the shame of the Republican Party and the nation. On the morning after the Harrisburg speech, the Trump administration announced that the White House would welcome a visit from the President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who has admitted to killing suspected drug dealers without first granting them trials. In his embrace of Duterte, who is a global pariah, a leader who loves to talk like a strong man honors a President who kills like one. It is a demonstration of character just as clear, and even more disturbing, than what he gave us in Pennsylvania.   If Trump has proven anything as President, it is that he is unable or unwilling to do the job to which he was elected. This weekend alone, he has shown us he is not interested in uniting the country, inspiring action and fashioning a bright American future. Instead, he is content to take Theodore Roosevelt’s description of the office of the presidency as a ”bully pulpit” quite literally."
"(Reuters) Four vessels from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) “harassed” a U. S. destroyer on Tuesday by carrying out a “high speed intercept” in the vicinity of the Strait of Hormuz, a U. S. defense official said on Wednesday. [The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said two of the Iranian vessels came within 300 yards of the USS Nitze in an incident that was “unsafe and unprofessional. ”  “The Iranian high rate of closure  …    created a dangerous, harassing situation that could have led to further escalation including additional defensive measures by Nitze,” the official said. The IRGC, the Islamic Republic’s praetorian guard, is suspicious of U. S. military activity near Iran’s borders. The Guards operate land and naval units separate from the regular armed forces and stage frequent war games in the Gulf, which separates Iran from its regional rival Saudi Arabia and a U. S. naval base in Bahrain. Read the full story at Reuters."
"Jeb Bush, the   presumptive Republican nominee, is facing a very real money crunch. His campaign raised only $7 million in the last three months of last year. Fundraising for his once mammouth Right to Rise super PAC has also dried up. [Without a big surge in New Hampshire next week, Jeb’s campaign will come to an end very soon.  According to FEC reports, Jeb Bush’s campaign raised just $7 million in the 4th Quarter, the period encompassing  . This is less than half the amount raised by Marco Rubio ($14 million) Ted Cruz ($15 million) or Ben Carson ($20 million). Jeb Bush also spent far more than he raised in the 4th Quarter. He spent almost $10 million in the final three months  —   a feature of his large, national campaign. His campaign only had $7. 5 million in the bank at the end of 2015, a small amount, just as paid advertising takes on a larger role as voting begins. Ted Cruz, by comparison, had $19 million cash on hand at the end of 2015. Worse for Bush, though, is the dramatic drop in contributions to his super PAC, Right to Rise. At the beginning of the campaign, the super PAC announced a massive $103 million war chest, a show of fundraising muscle designed to scare away other potential candidates. Since that initial funding haul, however, the super PAC raised only $15 million in the last half of 2015. Right to Rise spent just about half its total by the end of 2015. It reported around $58 million at the end of the year. This amount has obviously been reduced considerably, as January witnessed enormous spending by the super PAC in both Iowa and New Hampshire, where advertising is particularly expensive. Jeb’s fundraising prowess, combined with the extenstive donor network built up over the years by the Bush family, was supposed to ensure that he had the resources to compete deep into the primary season. These latest reports, however, suggest his campaign may not survive past the second week of February. Thirty years ago, the   company devoted tens of millions of dollars and all of its marketing expertise to sell the country on New Coke. It failed, because the public didn’t like the product. All the money in the world can’t sell a product the public doesn’t want. The Jeb Bush campaign is yet another reminder of that old rule."
" (CNN) Jonny Quest is going into action once again. The animated adventures of the young adventurer thrilled kids in the 1960s (and in the many reboots that followed) but now he’s headed for the big screen in   form. Even though the show lasted one season (due to the high cost of the animation) it’s still regarded as a great early example of animated  .

As yet unknown are who will play Jonny, his friend Hadji, his father and   tough guy Race Bannon. (”Jonny Quest” is owned by Time Warner, as is CNN.) Twitter lit up with reaction in favor of and against remaking the classic cartoon almost immediately. ”No, no, no, no. For Pete’s sake, leave Jonny Quest alone,” tweeted ”MK Fonz 11.”  ”Do these studios have no imagination?” ”Joseph” made it quite simple: ”Not watching Robert Rodriguez’s Jonny Quest movie if Danny Trejo [from Rodriguez’s ’Machete’ movies] isn’t cast as Race Bannon.” Others had thoughts on who should be cast, like Idris Elba as Race Bannon. Like so many    adaptations (”Jem and the Holograms” anyone?) the debate is unlikely to end there."

"Michigan has one of the largest Muslim populations of any state, yet 6 out of 10 Republicans in the state favored a temporary ban on Muslim visitors to the United States, according to early exit poll results from CNN. [The proposal  —   championed by Republican frontrunner Donald J. Trump  —   was even more popular in Mississippi, where 7 out of 10 Republicans favored a ban on Muslim travel. Those proportions match the range of responses among the states that voted a week ago on Tuesday, ranging from 64% (Virginia) to Alabama (78%).  The exit polls confirm recent public polling results, such as a WXYZ   Free Press poll that showed 61% support in Michigan for a ban on Muslims. Local Muslims in Michigan reacted with concern at the poll results. The exit poll results bode well for Trump, who is thought to be facing a fairly strong challenge in Michigan from Ohio Gov. John Kasich."
"’  ’ ’   Your success in a salary negotiation often comes down to how you   frame your request. ’ ’   Using four simple words  —   when,   I, feel, and need    —   could mean the difference between an open   communication with your boss and your requests falling on deaf   ears. ’ ’   Dr. Michael McNulty, a master trainer from  and founder   of  tells Business Insider that   those who want to express a concern in any relationship should do   so in a positive manner, avoid blaming language, use mostly ”I”   statements, and discuss your perspective, feelings, and needs,   which is called the ”gentle startup” technique. ’ ’   It looks something like: ”When X happens or   happened, I feel Y, and I need   Z.” ’ ’   Here’’s how you might ask for a raise using the ”gentle startup”   technique: ’ ’’ ’”When I look at my credentials and how hard I am   working and compare my salary to others in my field . .. ’ ’   ”I really feel discouraged.   ”I feel worried about my family’’s financial   future.   ”I feel kind of sad, because I want to stay   here.   ”I like the people and the company.   ”I do not feel like my contributions are seen or   understood.   ”I feel resentful. ’ ’   ”I need my salary to be reviewed.   ”I need a higher salary.   ”I need the opportunity for bonuses or profit   sharing.” ’ ’   ”This technique is so helpful in relationships of all kinds,”   McNulty says. ”It helps to guard against the tendency that people   feel to justify their feelings and needs so much so that they   come off as critical or blaming to the other person before they   are able to express what they feel and ask for what they want.” ’ ’ show that the parts of the brain that handle   logic and reason go to sleep when people begin to feel attacked,   while the parts of the brain responsible for the      response light up. ’ ’   As Harvard Business School lecturers John Neffinger and Matthew   Kohut observe in the book ”,” a   discussion is no longer an exercise in logic and reasoning when   it becomes an argument. ’ ’   One surefire way to make your boss feel criticized and defensive   and ultimately shut down the discussion before it ever begins is   to use what relationship experts call a ”harsh startup.” ’ ’   According to McNulty, in a salary negotiation this might sound   like: ”You and this company just don’’t seem to care at all about   my needs. How am I supposed to support a family on this? Who   knows how anyone gets a raise around here anyway? If something   does not change, I am gone!” ’ ’   In romantic relationships, ”if partners start a conversation in a   negative manner, 97% of the time that conversation will end   negatively,” McNulty says. And as John Gottman, a psychologist,   couples counselor, and relationships researcher for 40 years,   posited in his book ”,” the same principles that make marriages   work also hold true for many other kinds of relationships, like   work relationships. ’ ’   One way to avoid a harsh startup is to ask for a raise as soon as   .

"Washington (CNN) Don’t think because they won marriage equality in 2015 they would rest easy.  The LGBT community came out en masse in Washington for the Equality March, pressing the new White House to continue progress made by the previous administration. The march Sunday was vibrant, in attire and color.   There were rainbow pride flags, trans pride flags, even American and Puerto Rican flags with rainbows as their stripes. The energy was palpable, even as they lined up sporadic cheers would overtake the crowd, interrupting percussive protest chants. And then it suddenly got quiet.  Soft singing soon overtook the soft fluttered of flags in the breeze, ”Oh, say can you see. ..”  The national anthem. More and more joined the chorus as the song neared its apex, roaring towards the final lines. As it concluded, the crowds let up a thunderous cheer.  The march had begun. Wayne Pawlowski and Ted carried one of those bright rainbow pride flags near the front of the parade.  Ted declined to give CNN his full name he knows that his marriage and his sexual orientation could get him fired. Wayne and Ted have been together for 35 years, married for nine of them. Ted, like three out of five Americans according to the Human Rights Campaign, could be fired simply for being gay.  ”There’s a lot of basic rights that we as gay people don’t have that a lot of Americans do and take for granted,” said Ted.  ”We need to change that.” But Ted, 62, and Pawlowski, 71, have a unique historical artifact  —   their rainbow pride flag.   They flew it at the capital’s first ever LGBT protest on October 14, 1979.  And they’ve brought it to every single Pride celebration and protest they’ve ever gone to since.   Jasmine and Nette Archangel made the trip North from Louisiana to be here  —   they brought their whole family.  For them, the march was about being visible. ”We want our family to be normalized, not just tolerated,” said Nette, 32.  ”Our family’s made out of love.”   Last year, the couple made a big move from rural Louisiana into New Orleans, a place they feel ”more accepted.”   Jasmine, 33, is a bit more shy.  ”I want my sons to know no matter what they decide to do, we love them regardless,” she says through a smile.   The Archangels weren’t the only family to travel from Louisiana.  Erin Crisham and Monica Herbert brought their    son Cullen to the march.   ”We want to make sure that voices are still being heard,” said Crisham.  ”Legislation continues to progress and not stall.”  Crisham, like many in the community, saw a number of LGBT rights victories.  Now, with a new President at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, they want to maintain that progress.   ”We don’t want to see anything stay stagnant,” she said.  ”We don’t want to see anything take steps back.  We really want to see things continue to move forward.” The community won those   victories by the grassroots organizing of their organizations.  They rapidly and fundamentally shifted American public thought on a variety of LGBT issues by coming out  —   to their families, friends and coworkers  —   and pressuring their politicians. So how will the community pressure continued progress on LGBT issues in President Donald Trump’s America? They’ll stay involved and start at home, just like they always did.  Crisham and Herbet are going to work with local LGBT family organizations  —   just like the Archangels.  And they agree with the Archangels their family needs to be treated like anyone else’s. She says sometimes people just aren’t used to having different types of families around them.  It’s a matter of getting them used to it.    ”Sometimes, we’re the educators for that,” she said.  For Ted, it’s simple.  He’s going to make sure he’s at the ballot box each election voting for   candidates, ”whenever we can.”   His husband Wayne is going to support the organizations that helped make marriage equality the law of the land.   ”We are going to go back to Florida tomorrow,” he said.  ”The first thing we’re going to do is send more donations (supportive organizations including Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union) . .. the organizations that fight for us in ways that we can’t individually.” Clayton Whitehead, 29, agrees.  He sprained his ankle playing flag football earlier in the week but did not let that, or the crutch he has to walk with, stop him from marching.   The march was, ”only the beginning.”   ”We have to get involved at the local level,” he says.  ”Have the courage to speak up.  Go to your community meetings.  Your council meetings.  Vote in your local elections.  Those are just as important as our national elections.” Lou and John Thompson, both 69, came to Washington from Conway, Arkansas, for their first Pride and their first political protest.   They held a sign that reads, ”We love our (single) gay son!”  Their son Brock’s sign read, ”I love my (annoying but  ) straight parents!”  ”We need to make a stand at times,” said Thompson, who thinks now is not the time to be silent. ”In our churches. City council.  Just every little opportunity that you get to make a stand, I think you need to say something.” Brock Thompson agrees. ”We’re going to march every day if we need to,” he says, beaming.

"Sunday on  ’s “Facing South Florida,” while discussing Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memos on the new guidelines for how to implement the Trump administration’s executive order on immigration, Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) questioned the “humanitarian rationale” behinds those memos.  Rubio said, “We need to acknowledge that there is no right to illegally immigrate to the United States. Then there is the human side, and that is, okay, there is no legal right but is there not a humanitarian rationale for perhaps allowing some of the people here legally to remain because they have been here a long time because they are good people because they were brought here as children. ” He continued, “The answer is I think quite frankly they’ll have a lot of questions about whether it’s the best use of our resources. ” Rubio added, “I think the implementation of it is much more intense from what I’m hearing. Stories I’m hearing of how it’s actually being implemented. For example, individuals who have never had a run in with the law somehow take a stop sign they get pulled over, they could get turned in, and they can’t prove they been here for two years, and they are deported out of the country. I think if that’s the way it’s applied you are going to have to spend a lot of money to do it number one and you are going to have to deal with the humanitarian reality that over time the America people are going to say maybe this is not what we meant. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
"Elie Wiesel, the Auschwitz survivor who became an eloquent witness for the six million Jews slaughtered in World War II and who, more than anyone else, seared the memory of the Holocaust on the world’s conscience, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87. Menachem Rosensaft, a longtime friend and the founding chairman of the International Network of Children of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, confirmed the death in a phone call. Mr. Wiesel, a charismatic lecturer and humanities professor, was the author of several dozen books. In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But he was defined not so much by the work he did as by the gaping void he filled. In the aftermath of the Germans’ systematic massacre of Jews, no voice had emerged to drive home the enormity of what had happened and how it had changed mankind’s conception of itself and of God. For almost two decades, the traumatized survivors  —   and American Jews,   that they had not done more to rescue their brethren  —   seemed frozen in silence. But by the sheer force of his personality and his gift for the haunting phrase, Mr. Wiesel, who had been liberated from Buchenwald as a    with the indelible tattoo   on his arm, gradually exhumed the Holocaust from the burial ground of the history books. It was this speaking out against forgetfulness and violence that the Nobel committee recognized when it awarded him the peace prize in 1986. “Wiesel is a messenger to mankind,” the Nobel citation said. “His message is one of peace, atonement and human dignity. His belief that the forces fighting evil in the world can be victorious is a   belief. ” Mr. Wiesel first gained attention in 1960 with the English translation of “Night,” his autobiographical account of the horrors he witnessed in the camps as a teenage boy. He wrote of how he had been plagued by guilt for having survived while millions died, and tormented by doubts about a God who would allow such slaughter. “Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed,” Mr. Wiesel wrote. “Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God himself. Never. ” Mr. Wiesel went on to write novels, books of essays and reportage, two plays and even two cantatas. While many of his books were nominally about topics like Soviet Jews or Hasidic masters, they all dealt with profound questions resonating out of the Holocaust: What is the sense of living in a universe that tolerates unimaginable cruelty? How could the world have been mute? How can one go on believing? Mr. Wiesel asked the questions in spare prose and without raising his voice he rarely offered answers. “If I survived, it must be for some reason,” he told Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times in an interview in 1981. “I must do something with my life. It is too serious to play games with anymore, because in my place, someone else could have been saved. And so I speak for that person. On the other hand, I know I cannot. ” There may have been better chroniclers who evoked the hellish minutiae of the German death machine. There were arguably more illuminating philosophers. But no single figure was able to combine Mr. Wiesel’s moral urgency with his magnetism, which emanated from his deeply lined face and eyes as unrelievable melancholy. “He has the look of Lazarus about him,” the Roman Catholic writer François Mauriac wrote of Mr. Wiesel, a friend. President Obama, who visited the site of the Buchenwald concentration camp with Mr. Wiesel in 2009, called him a “living memorial. ” “He raised his voice, not just against   but against hatred, bigotry and intolerance in all its forms,” the president said in a statement on Saturday. “He implored each of us, as nations and as human beings, to do the same, to see ourselves in each other and to make real that pledge of ‘never again. ’” Mr. Wiesel long grappled with what he called his “dialectical conflict”: the need to recount what he had seen and the futility of explaining an event that defied reason and imagination. In his Nobel speech, he said that what he had done with his life was to try “to keep memory alive” and “to fight those who would forget. ” “Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices,” he said. A year earlier, on April 19, 1985, Mr. Wiesel stirred deep emotions when, at a White House ceremony at which he accepted the Congressional Gold Medal of Achievement, he tried to dissuade President Ronald Reagan from taking time from a planned trip to West Germany to visit a military cemetery there, in Bitburg, where members of Hitler’s elite Waffen SS were buried. “That place, Mr. President, is not your place,” he said. “Your place is with victims of the SS. ” Mr. Reagan, amid much criticism, went ahead and laid a wreath at Bitburg. Paradoxically, the confrontation led to Mr. Wiesel’s first postwar visit to Germany. He said afterward that he had been extremely moved by the young German students he met and the depth of their painful search for an understanding of their country’s past. He urged reconciliation. “Has Germany ever asked us to forgive?” Mr. Wiesel asked. “To my knowledge, no such plea was ever made. With whom am I to speak about forgiveness, I, who don’t believe in collective guilt? Who am I to believe in collective innocence?” Mr. Wiesel had a leading role in the creation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, serving as chairman of the commission that united rival survivor groups to raise funds for a permanent structure. The museum became one of Washington’s most powerful attractions. “He was a singular moral voice,” said Sara J. Bloomfield, the museum’s director. “And he brought a kind of moral and intellectual leadership and eloquence, not only to the memory of the Holocaust, but to the lessons of the Holocaust, that was just incomparable. There is nothing that can replace the survivor voice  —   that power, that authenticity. ” In his 1966 book, “The Jews of Silence: A Personal Report on Soviet Jewry,” Mr. Wiesel called attention to Jews who were being persecuted for their religion and yet barred from emigrating. “What torments me most is not the Jews of silence I met in Russia, but the silence of the Jews I live among today,” he said. His efforts helped ease emigration restrictions. Mr. Wiesel condemned the massacres in Bosnia in the    —   “If this is Auschwitz again, we must mobilize the whole world,” he said  —   and denounced others in Cambodia, Rwanda and the Darfur region of Sudan. He condemned the burnings of black churches in the United States and spoke out on behalf of the blacks of South Africa and the tortured political prisoners of Latin America. Yet the plight of Jews was foremost. In 2013, when the United States was in talks with Iran about limiting that country’s nuclear weapons capability, Mr. Wiesel took out a   advertisement in The Times urging Mr. Obama to insist on a “total dismantling of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure” and its “repudiation of genocidal intent against Israel. ” Central to Mr. Wiesel’s work was reconciling the concept of a benevolent God with the evil of the Holocaust. “Usually we say, ‘God is right,’ or ‘God is just’  —   even during the Crusades we said that,” he once observed. “But how can you say that now, with one million children dead?” Still, he never abandoned faith indeed, he became more devout as the years passed, praying near his home or in Brooklyn’s Hasidic synagogues. On the airplane that was to take him to an Israel darkened by the   war in 1973, he sat shoeless with a friend, and together they hummed Hasidic melodies. “If I have problems with God, why should I blame the Sabbath?” he once said. Mr. Wiesel had his detractors. The literary critic Alfred Kazin wondered whether he had embellished some stories, and questions were raised about whether “Night” was a memoir or a novel, as it was sometimes classified on high school reading lists. Mr. Wiesel blazed a trail that produced libraries of Holocaust literature and countless film and television dramatizations. While some of this work was enduring, he denounced much of it as “trivialization. ” What gave him his moral authority in particular was that Mr. Wiesel, as a pious Torah student, had lived the hell of Auschwitz in his flesh. Eliezer Wiesel was born on Sept. 30, 1928, in the small city of Sighet, in the Carpathian Mountains near the Ukrainian border in what was then Romania. His father, Shlomo, was a   shopkeeper worldly enough to encourage his son to learn modern Hebrew and introduce him to the works of Freud. Later in life, Mr. Wiesel was able to describe his father in less saintly terms, as a preoccupied man he rarely saw until they were thrown together in Auschwitz. His mother, the former Sarah Feig, and his maternal grandfather, Dodye Feig, a Viznitz Hasid, filled his imagination with mystical tales of Hasidic masters. He grew up with his three sisters, Hilda, Batya and Tzipora, in a setting reminiscent of Sholom Aleichem’s stories. “You went out on the street on Saturday and felt Shabbat in the air,” he wrote of his community of 15, 000 Jews. But his idyllic childhood was shattered in the spring of 1944 when the Nazis marched into Hungary. With Allied troops fast approaching, many of Sighet’s Jews convinced themselves that they might be spared. But the city’s Jews were swiftly confined to two ghettos and then assembled for deportation. “One by one, they passed in front of me,” he wrote in “Night,” “teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs. ” “Night” recounted a journey of several days spent in an airless cattle car before the narrator and his family arrived in a place they had never heard of: Auschwitz. Mr. Wiesel recalled how the smokestacks filled the air with the stench of burning flesh, how babies were burned in a pit, and how a monocled Dr. Josef Mengele decided, with a wave of a bandleader’s baton, who would live and who would die. Mr. Wiesel watched his mother and his sister Tzipora walk off to the right, his mother protectively stroking Tzipora’s hair. “I did not know that in that place, at that moment, I was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever,” he wrote. In Auschwitz and in a nearby labor camp called Buna, where he worked loading stones onto railway cars, Mr. Wiesel turned feral under the pressures of starvation, cold and daily atrocities. “Night” recounts how he became so obsessed with getting his plate of soup and crust of bread that he watched guards beat his father with an iron bar while he had “not flickered an eyelid” to help. When Buna was evacuated as the Russians approached, its prisoners were forced to run for miles through high snow. Those who stumbled were crushed in the stampede. After the prisoners were taken by train to another camp, Buchenwald, Mr. Wiesel watched his father succumb to dysentery and starvation and shamefully confessed that he had wished to be relieved of the burden of sustaining him. When his father’s body was taken away on Jan. 29, 1945, he could not weep. “I had no more tears,” he wrote. On April 11, after eating nothing for six days, Mr. Wiesel was among those liberated by the United States Third Army. Years later, he identified himself in a famous photograph among the skeletal men lying supine in a Buchenwald barracks. Only after the war did he learn that his two elder sisters had not perished. In the days after Buchenwald’s liberation, he decided that he had survived to bear witness, but vowed that he would not speak or write of what he had seen for 10 years. “I didn’t want to use the wrong words,” he once explained. He was placed on a train of 400 orphans that was diverted to France, and he was assigned to a home in Normandy under the care of a Jewish organization. There he mastered French by reading the classics, and in 1948 he enrolled in the Sorbonne. He supported himself as a tutor, a Hebrew teacher and a translator and began writing for the French newspaper L’Arche. In 1948, L’Arche sent him to Israel to report on that newly founded state. He became the Paris correspondent for the daily Yediot Ahronot as well, and in that role he interviewed Mr. Mauriac, who encouraged him to write about his war experiences. In 1956 he produced an   memoir in Yiddish. Pared to 127 pages and translated into French, it then appeared as “La Nuit. ” It took more than a year to find an American publisher, Hill  Wang, which offered him an advance of just $100. Though well reviewed, the book sold only 1, 046 copies in the first 18 months. “The Holocaust was not something people wanted to know about in those days,” Mr. Wiesel told Time magazine in 1985. The mood shifted after Adolf Eichmann was captured in Argentina by Israel in 1960 and the wider world, in watching his televised trial in Jerusalem, began to grasp anew the enormity of the German crimes. Mr. Wiesel began speaking more widely, and as his popularity grew, he came to personify the Holocaust survivor. “Night” went on to sell more than 10 million copies, three million of them after Oprah Winfrey picked it for her book club in 2006 and traveled with Mr. Wiesel to Auschwitz. Mr. Wiesel wrote an average of a book a year, 60 books by his own count in 2015. Many were translated from French by his   wife, Marion Erster Rose, who survived the war hidden in Vichy, France. They married in Jerusalem in 1969, when Mr. Wiesel was 40, and they had one son, Shlomo Elisha. They survive him, as do a stepdaughter, Jennifer Rose, and two grandchildren. For Mr. Wiesel, fame did not erase the scars left by the Holocaust  —   the nightmares, the perpetual insecurity, the inability to laugh deeply. “I live in constant fear,” he said in 1983. In 2007, a    man who called Mr. Wiesel’s account of the Holocaust fictitious pulled him out of a hotel elevator in San Francisco and attacked him. (The man was convicted of assault.) From 1972 to 1976, Mr. Wiesel was a professor of Judaic studies at City College, where many of his students were children of survivors. In 1976 he was appointed the Andrew W. Mellon professor in the humanities at Boston University, and that job became his institutional anchor. In an effort to promote understanding between conflicting ethnic groups, Mr. Wiesel also started the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. Through a synagogue acquaintance of Mr. Wiesel’s, it invested its endowment with the money manager Bernard L. Madoff, and his   Ponzi scheme, revealed in 2008, cost the foundation $15 million. Mr. Wiesel and his wife lost millions of dollars in personal savings as well. Mr. Wiesel lived long enough to achieve a particular satisfying redemption. In 2002, he dedicated a museum in his hometown, Sighet, in the very house from which he and his family had been deported to Auschwitz. With uncommon emotion, he told the young Romanians in the crowd, “When you grow up, tell your children that you have seen a Jew in Sighet telling his story. ”"
"A Lexington, SC business owner says he is being told to remove the 10 American flags he put up outside of his business to celebrate the upcoming Fourth of July holiday, WISTV reports.  Bob Michaelis of Michaelis Mattress Company says he was asked to remove his display because it violates a 1999 town ordinance, which states only three flags that are not duplicates of each other can be displayed in “restricted and intense development districts. ” “We got 10 flags up,” Michaelis, a former Marine, told a WISTV reporter. “I thought maybe it was about time we return to the patriotism in America. There’s not enough of it. It seems to be lost. ” Lexington Police Department let Michaelis know the display violated the ordinance, and told him to remove the flags. “I put them up yesterday and the city and the town of Lexington says they got to come down because there’s an ordinance in place,” Michaelis said. Even though violation of the ordinance could cost him in fines, Michaelis does not plan to take the flags down. “I think we should respect the ordinance,” Michaelis admitted to the reporter. “They’re there to protect everybody. I think that a little lenience on special holidays would be great. ” Lexington Mayor Steve MacDougall released the following statement regarding the flag display on his Facebook page: In response to the Article that has so many upset, let me be perfectly clear  —   The Chief of Police, the most respected law enforcement officer in the community, was asked to go by and speak with the store owner about the display and to inform him of the ordinance, we never forced or asked him to take down the flags. We were not given a chance by WIS to respond to this claim until 1:45 when they called while I was meeting with Britt Poole. The ordinance has been on the books since 1999 when Council at the time acted on a negative situation involving the Confederate Flag that required them to create todays guidelines for all flags. It is never our intent to interfere with a business but we have a duty to protect our community and we do that with great pride. We have members of our community that have fought, and died for our freedom to display this great symbol of our United States of America. Please, if the intent was to honor those than by all means do so but do not use this symbol as an advertising piece for your fourth of July sale. The Lexington store is the only store that has this display  —   if it were truly a display to “honor the troops” it would be at all four stores. To those of you who continue to comment and hurl allegations about situations that arise in our great town, all I ask is that you hear the facts before you pass judgement on those of us who serve you. Thank youMayor Steve MacDougall, On Tuesday, it was reported that a man in Colorado was told to take down his American flag display, deemed equivalent to clutter, from his apartment balcony.

"“Let’s get her some sex. ” Susan Silver says that was one of her chief contributions as a writer on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show. ” Playing the beloved young housewife Laura Petrie a few years earlier, Ms. Moore and her TV husband, Dick Van Dyke, had been made to sleep in separate beds. But it was the 1970s now. Even good girls had sex. Ms. Silver and the other women writing for “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” made sure of it. [ Read Mary Tyler Moore’s obituary | How she changed fashion ] As Ms. Moore’s new sitcom character, the independent, single career woman Mary Richards, put it in one episode: “I’m hardly innocent. I’ve been around. Well, all right I might not have been around. But I’ve been nearby. ” Ms. Silver said there was no particular feminist agenda for the show. There was, however, an   number of female writers on it  —   well over a dozen in the show’s   run that started in 1970. They were encouraged, she said, to write from their own experience, and to let Mary Richards’s   derive “organically. ” That made “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” a laboratory for the social issues of the day, which in some cases were being reflected for the first time on   television. Sex, birth control, equal pay, workplace sexism, homosexuality  —   all took a turn on the show, and not from the bully pulpit but from the “girl” who could turn the world on with her smile. Here’s how they played: When Lou Grant (Ed Asner) interviews Mary Richards for an associate producer job in his Minneapolis TV newsroom, he asks questions that women in the workplace often got asked but that weren’t necessarily legal: How old are you? Are you married? Divorced? What religion are you? She calls him out but answers anyway, in the show’s first episode. The point was not belabored but Mary Richards slept with her boyfriends. A   Chicago journalist had suggested that Mary, who was 30 when the series began, was “undersexed,” Ms. Silver said, and so in Season 3, Ms. Silver wrote an episode in which Mary asked her friend Rhoda if that was the case. A few episodes later, Mary goes on a date and comes home the next morning in the same dress. “Men across the country wrote to the show in despair over the betrayal of their trust and admiration,” Jennifer Keishin Armstrong wrote in her 2013 book, “Mary and Lou and Rhoda and Ted: And All the Brilliant Minds That Made ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show’ a Classic. ” The third season featured another   handled in a    way. Mary’s friend Phyllis (Cloris Leachman) tries to push her brother into Mary’s arms, but the brother (Robert Moore) is more taken with Phyllis’s archnemesis, Rhoda (Valerie Harper). Phyllis works herself into a lather over this development, until Rhoda puts her out of her misery. “He’s not my type,” she reassures Phyllis, who remains skeptical. No really, Rhoda says. “He’s gay. ” Mr. Moore himself was gay, and he embraced the late decision to out the character this plainly, Ms. Armstrong writes in her book, especially since all the laughs were directed at his clueless TV sister. Had the Pill ever been mentioned in a sitcom script before “Mary Tyler Moore”? If so, the moment has been lost to history. Not long after the   episode, Mary’s father, at loose ends after his retirement, is visiting Mary for dinner at her apartment. Mary’s mother, making her exit, turns at the door. “Don’t forget to take your pill!” she calls out. “I won’t,” father and daughter answer in unison. Cut to the comically guilty look on Mary’s face. The Pill had won federal approval in 1960, but it was only that year, 1972, that a Supreme Court decision had made it available to unmarried women. And Mary was unmarried, for all seven seasons. Early hopes to make her a divorcée from the outset were instantly quashed by queasy executives. “It used to be I felt I could be myself. Now I feel I represent women everywhere. ” The third season opens with Mary kvetching to Rhoda as she prepares for a meeting at the TV station, where she resents the station manager “trotting in groups of people and saying, ‘This is our woman executive. ’” Her views take on a slightly different cast when she discovers that she makes $50 a week less than the man who had her job before her. She confronts Lou, asking him why. “Because he was a man,” Lou says. “The Dick Van Dyke Show” ended just four years before “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” made its premiere, even though it seemed the two shows were worlds apart. Ms. Moore broke ground in the earlier show, too, though. When the script called for her to vacuum in skirt and heels, she put her foot (in ballet flat) down and her Capri pants on. “We got the absolution of men everywhere,” she told TV Guide a few years ago, “and women kind of breathed a sigh of relief, too, and said: ‘Hey, that’s right. That’s what we wear. ’”"

"Washington (CNN) Rep. Jerrold Nadler said in an interview Friday that President Donald Trump’s dismissal of FBI Director James Comey and subsequent tweet that Comey ”better hope” their conversations weren’t taped add up to a ”strong case” that Trump tried to obstruct justice. The New York Democrat’s comments come after news reports that Trump requested Comey pledge his loyalty to the President at a dinner shortly after Trump took office. Nadler’s remarks also follow the President’s comment in an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt on Thursday that he considered the FBI’s investigation of alleged collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials in his decision to fire the FBI director. ”Asking for loyalty of the FBI, which is supposed to be independent    especially when he just admitted he was thinking of firing Comey essentially because of the Russian investigation    those two things combined make a very strong case for the President having committed an obstruction of justice and that’s got to be investigated,” Nadler said on CNN’s ”Erin Burnett OutFront.” On Friday, Trump tweeted: ”James Comey better hope that there are no ’tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press.” The President’s reasoning for dismissing Comey, which Trump told NBC News was something he had been planning to do before it was recommended by his attorney general and deputy attorney general, ”raises a very serious concern about obstruction of justice, about obstructing that investigation,” Nadler said. Other US officials, including prominent GOP lawmakers such as Sen. John McCain, have said they were ”troubled” by Trump’s abrupt firing of Comey  . Many Democratic lawmakers are calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor to take Comey’s place leading the probe. When he fired Comey earlier this week, Trump garnered comparisons to President Richard Nixon and his infamous decision to remove the special prosecutor investigating Watergate crimes in 1973.  Earlier Friday, Democratic Reps. Elijah Cummings and John Conyers, the respective ranking members of the House oversight and judiciary committees, requested from White House counsel Donald McGahn copies of all recordings between Trump and Comey.  In a letter, the two lawmakers also said Trump’s actions ”raise the specter of possible intimidation and obstruction of justice.” Still, Nadler said on CNN that it’s still ”too early” to talk about impeachment as an avenue Democrats would pursue. On Wednesday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal said on ”Anderson Cooper 360” that impeachment proceedings are a possibility, but he agreed that that would be a ways down the road.   ”It may well produce impeachment proceedings, although we’re very far from that possibility,” the Connecticut Democrat said. Like some lawmakers, including California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Nadler said he believes that if Trump did record conversations with Comey, which the President’s tweet suggested he did, then those recordings would be government property. ”I don’t know whether he taped those conversations,” Nadler said. ”But if he did, the Nixon court precedent says those tapes are the property of the government, must not be destroyed and should be turned over.”"

"Viacom is going it alone. The troubled media company named Robert M. Bakish as its new chief executive on Monday just hours after it received marching orders to stop exploring a combination with CBS. In a letter to the CBS and Viacom boards, Shari Redstone and her father, Sumner Redstone, who built the $40 billion media empire, said the two companies should continue on independent paths “based on our assessment of the strengths, progress, and future prospects of both companies. ” It was a sharp reversal to their blunt and public position three months ago, when the Redstones all but demanded that the companies reunite. But Ms. Redstone’s plan depended on winning over Leslie Moonves, the highly regarded chairman and chief executive of CBS Corporation, whom she had wanted to run the combined entity. And Mr. Moonves had expressed doubt about how such a deal would benefit both Viacom, which has struggled, and CBS, which has prospered, long before the Redstones proposed the merger in September. For Mr. Moonves, not only did the valuation of the deal have to be right, but he also sought a level of strategic and operational freedom over the combined companies, according to three people briefed on the discussions who requested anonymity because the talks were private. Over the past three months, special board committees at each company worked with advisers to explore the potential combination, although the two sides never reached the point of discussing specific pricing and other deal terms, according to one of the people briefed on the discussion. Ultimately, the two sides could not agree on valuation, especially as the Viacom side grew increasingly optimistic about the company’s future under the leadership of Mr. Bakish. In the past month, since Mr. Bakish stepped into the role as interim chief, he impressed Viacom directors with his vision to revive its struggling television and film businesses. Mr. Bakish, who started at Viacom in 1997, previously led the company’s international group and was considered a strong contender to assume the position permanently should Viacom remain independent. An engineer by training, Mr. Bakish is respected across the company for delivering strong results at his unit even as the rest of Viacom faltered. Mr. Bakish, 52, has outlined his strategy in broad strokes  —   reinvigorating MTV, Comedy Central and other Viacom TV networks for the digital age, returning Paramount Pictures to growth, expanding the company’s international footprint  —   but has yet to reveal specific details. He is in the midst of working with executives and employees to create detailed   and   plans for the company. The challenges are daunting. In the latest fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the company reported a 25 percent plunge in profits and a 6 percent drop in revenues. Ms. Redstone, the vice chairwoman of Viacom’s board, said in a statement that she was “excited by the strategy. ” “While there is much work to do,” she continued, “I firmly believe that Viacom has a bright future, and that confidence is underpinned by senior management’s commitment to innovation and a more coordinated, global approach to managing our brands. ” The developments continue the   year for the entertainment empire controlled by Ms. Redstone and her father, Sumner, who is 93 and in poor health. The disruption included court battles in three states, the ousting of Viacom’s chief executive and now a complete turnaround on the call to combine CBS and Viacom. At Viacom, that drama is likely to continue as new management tries to reverse the company’s declining fortunes. CBS is expected to return to its steady position of strength. “This morning’s announcement marks a formal breaking up for now moreover, we do not envision a different suitor for Viacom,” Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura, said. The Redstone family controls about 80 percent of the voting stock in CBS and Viacom through National Amusements, the private   company started by Mr. Redstone’s father. Merging CBS and Viacom under Mr. Moonves previously was considered to have provided a quick solution to finding new leadership for Viacom. Earlier this year, Philippe P. Dauman was ousted as chief executive of Viacom. Thomas Dooley, the interim chief executive, then left in   when Mr. Bakish assumed the position. Ms. Redstone, who was a driving force behind the removal of Mr. Dauman, continued to publicly advocate the deal. At The New York Times’s DealBook conference in New York last month, she said the corporate merger was more important than ever before, because entertainment companies that create content needed to get bigger in order to increase their bargaining power against distributors like Comcast and ATT. “Scale matters because it is going to give us leverage,” Ms. Redstone said at the conference, “and we are going to need leverage with some partners. ” She did note, however, that it would be possible for the two companies to remain independent. “They are two strong companies, and they both will survive. ” In Monday’s letter to the CBS and Viacom boards, the Redstones said they had concluded that this was “not the right time to merge the companies. ’’ Shares in Viacom’s declined about 9 percent on Monday, while shares in CBS were about flat. Also on Monday, court documents filed by an   of Mr. Redstone’s raised new questions about his mental competence as well as corporate governance issues that have plagued the companies for more than a year. In October, Mr. Redstone sued two   over civil claims including elder abuse, seeking about $150 million that his lawyers said he was tricked into giving the two women. Sydney Holland, the former girlfriend, said in the court filing that Mr. Redstone’s gift to her in May 2014 came at the same time that Mr. Redstone remained “very active in the business activities of Viacom and CBS. ” In the document, Ms. Holland states that Mr. Redstone gave several other women tens of millions of dollars in exchange for sexual favors, including a Paramount employee. Robert N. Klieger, a lawyer for Mr. Redstone, called the assertions “a work of fiction punctuated by    threats of extortion and an overwhelming stench of greed. ”"
"A Mexican woman was arrested by U. S. Border Patrol agents after entering the United States illegally from Canada. A Canadian citizen was also arrested for allegedly helping smuggle the woman across the border. [U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers became suspicious of a Canadian citizen who was crossing the border at the Port of Mooers, New York, port of entry. Lukasz Kabata, 20, was crossing from Canada into New York by himself. Officers conducting a secondary inspection observed a large number of women’s clothes and another person’s immigration documents in the vehicle and became suspicious.  A tip from a citizen was referred to Border Patrol agents who found Johan Lizeth   18, about a mile from the port of entry. The agents determined she had crossed the border without inspection and was traveling with Kabata. The arrest of the two individuals illustrates the teamwork between the two federal agencies that is necessary to help secure our borders. “The Border Patrol mission to secure the border between the Ports of Entry cannot be accomplished without integrating our operations with our Customs and Border Protection partners as well as with the border community. This arrest exemplifies the team approach to border security that is necessary to be successful,” said Patrol Agent in Charge Norman Lague of the Champlain Border Patrol Station. Area Port of Champlain Acting Port Director Don Yando added, “CBP officers are trained to detect the signs of human smuggling. The arrest and apprehension is an excellent example of the vigilance of our officers, and outstanding teamwork with Border Patrol to secure our border. ” Breitbart Texas’ Lana Shadwick reported in July that Canada and Mexico had reached an agreement whereby Mexican citizens can travel to Canada without obtaining a visa. Jessica Vaughn, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies told Shadwick, “Canada will now become even more of a launching point for illegal entry into the United States. ” She said the opportunity to enter from Canada “could be enticing because some parts of our southern border have been hardened and are now very difficult to cross without being detected. ” Vaughn said entering through Canada would be especially of interest to “those Mexicans who have been deported already from the United States, or anyone who fraudulently obtains a Mexican passport, might seek to enter the United States illegally from Canada across our largely unguarded northern border. ” “It will be interesting to see if Canada develops an overstay problem with Mexicans, or if there develops a new stream of entry to the U. S. across the northern border,” Vaughn continued. “This could mean that we will need to bolster our border security efforts on the northern border as well as the southern border. ” In this case, Kabata was arrested and charged with human smuggling.   was charged with illegal entry without inspection. No report was made as to whether   will be deported back to Mexico, Canada, or not at all. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

"A Wikileaks email with the subject heading “Cecil the lion” reveals that Hillary Clinton presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta, asked a New York Times journalist to write an   calling for the extradition of Cecil’s killer. [Podesta wrote, “as the only person anyone knows who has spent time in a Zimbabwe jail, you should pen an oped calling for his killer’s extradition. What an asshole. ”  He added in his email to bearak@nytimes. com, “Missed you at the  . ” The email was apparently sent to Pulitzer Prize winning, New York Times correspondent Barry Bearak. Bearak was jailed in Zimbabwe in 2008 when he was in the country reporting on the elections there. He was charged with the crime of “committing journalism,” he wrote. The charges against him were later dismissed. The Democratic presidential campaign chair and Clinton confidant sent the email on August 1, 2015, right after the “Cecil the Lion” controversy began. Cecil the Lion became a household name on July 28 when reports hit that a Minnesota dentist had allegedly paid $50, 000 plus to illegally kill the lion. As reported by Breitbart News and UPI, the Safari Operators Association and the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, confirmed that a Bloomington, Minnesota dentist by the name of Walter James Palmer, was identified as the popular lion’s killer. Palmer allegedly paid for a private safari to hunt the    lion. Zimbabwe wildlife officials said the group used food to lure Cecil out of the protected Hwange National Park. The lion was shot with an arrow but it took 40 hours to find him before they could finish him off with a gun. The lion was found decapitated and skinned. Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit had been studying Cecil for years. The lion had been tagged and regularly seen by tourists on safari. The media and public backlash was swift. Hollywood celebrities took to social media to condemn Cecil’s killers. As reported by Breitbart, Sharon Osbourne, the wife of Ozzy Osbourne tweeted that Palmer was a “killer” and called him “Satan. ” The wife of the heavy metal singer who once bit the head off a bat added, “I don’t know how anyone could go to this man for dental services after this. ” Ricky Martin tweeted, “#JusticeforCecilTheLion NOW. ” Nancy Sinatra tweeted, “Thanks for caring about #CecilTheLion, Jimmy. Maybe that creep should be skinned  —   slowly  —   for 40 hours. @jimmykimmel. ” Mia Farrow tweeted the home address of the dentist, and when asked about the lion’s killer, Betty White said, “Do you really want to know? Anything loose cut off. ” “I deeply regret that my pursuit of an activity I love and practice responsibly and legally resulted in the taking of this lion,” Palmer told the public in a statement. He also said he would assist authorities with any inquiries. Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas. She has served as a prosecutor and associate judge in Texas.

"Washington (CNN) On Thursday, a rising star in the Democratic Party in Pennsylvania was charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy after allegedly leaking secret documents to a reporter to harm her predecessor, a criminal complaint says.  Just three days earlier, another top law enforcement official, this time a Republican in Texas, was charged with counts of securities fraud he’s accused of soliciting investors in a hometown company without disclosing he was profiting. These types of cases    unconnected except for their timing and elements of political retribution    are not uncommon, legal analysts say. ”Attorneys general are politicians, and they run into the same problem that other politicians do,” CNN Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said.  ”These two cases are common cases of white collar crime    abuse of power and fraud    and it just so happens that these two defendants are attorneys general,” Toobin added. Both defendants maintain their innocence, but the allegations and timing raise similar suspicions of political motives behind the charges and what happens when the top law official tasked with upholding the law allegedly goes rogue. The case in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State Attorney General Kathleen Kane was charged Thursday with obstruction and conspiracy after she allegedly leaked confidential information about grand jury deliberations to the media and then attempted to cover it up.  The back story    allegations riddled with political motives and retribution    is primarily rooted in two newspaper articles.  It began in March 2014, the criminal complaint says, when The Philadelphia Inquirer published a story called ”Sources: Kathleen Kane shut down probe of Philly Democrats.” See what Inquirer published online in 2014  That investigation at the center of that article was into individuals ”who had been caught in an undercover sting involving politicians accepting bribes.” The investigation was inherited by Kane from former Chief Deputy Attorney General Frank G. Fina before he left office, the criminal complaint said. Kane ”was angry about the article,” the complaint alleges, and that same day wrote an email to her media strategist, saying ”I will not allow them to discredit me or our office,” and ending with, ”This is war.” Her media strategist replied, ”make war with Fina but NOT to make war with the Inquirer.” The criminal complaint alleges that Kane then orchestrated the leaking of secret 2009 grand jury documents conducted under Fina and a senior deputy attorney general that looked into the misuse of grant money by an NAACP boss.  The NAACP boss was never charged with any crimes pertaining to that investigation, the complaint says. Accused of scheming to leak confidential information, Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman, a Republican who filed the charges against Kane, said that Kane had ”devised a scheme to secretly leak confidential information and secret grand jury materials” for retribution against Fina. Montgomery County is just north of Philadelphia. Ferman said Kane did this ”in the hopes of embarrassing and harming former state prosecutors whom she believed, without evidence, had made her look bad.” The other charges brought by Ferman allege that Kane then lied under oath to a grand jury about knowledge of the 2009 documents and her involvement in leaking them to journalists, among other things, to help cover up the crime. Kane, elected in 2012 and talked about by Pennsylvania Democrats as a top political contender in the state, vehemently denies the allegations. ”I intend to defend myself vigorously against these charges,” she said in a statement. ”A resignation would be an admission of guilt and I’m not guilty.” Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf called on her to step down Thursday, calling the charges ”troubling.” ”She is entitled to her day in court. She is entitled to due process under our system of government and law, and she will have time to defend herself and I think she needs to do that,” Wolf said. ”But in the meantime, I’m calling on her to step aside, step down as attorney general, because I don’t think she can do what she has to do as the top law enforcement officer in Pennsylvania while she’s facing these serious charges,” he added. ”The chief power an attorney general has is to bring cases and the risk is that they abuse that power for political gain and that is where they get in to trouble,” Toobin said. The case in Texas, A grand jury in Texas indicted Attorney General Ken Paxton, alleging he profited from soliciting investors in a local company without properly registering.  Paxton surrendered to authorities in Collin County, just north of Dallas, on Monday morning on two charges of securities fraud in excess of $100, 0000 and a third felony charge for allegedly advising or representing investors without properly registering, according to booking records.  The case against Paxton, an attorney and former state senator, began last year when he admitted violating state securities law by soliciting investment clients for the firm of his friend and campaign donor. Though Paxton was referring clients to his associate, he did not register with the state of Texas. He later paid a $1, 000 fine. ”Attorney General Ken Paxton will plead not guilty to these accusations, and he will demand a trial by jury. He is looking forward to the opportunity to tell his side of the story in the courtroom,” Paxton’s attorney, Joe Kendall, said in a statement Monday. The indictment of Paxton, elected to the attorney general’s post in November, comes almost a year after a Travis County grand jury brought charges against Rick Perry.  The former Texas governor, now seeking the 2016 Republican nomination, is still facing one felony charge of abuse of power a second charge was dropped. Paxton, a Republican, has also at times shared an alliance with the other Texan running for president, Ted Cruz. The Republican senator appeared in a television advertisement during Paxton’s primary battle in 2014, though Cruz did not endorse him. Paxton has not publicly commented on the charges, but his defenders    and Perry’s    have portrayed pending indictments as politically motivated. ”Some of the outrageous events surrounding this sloppy process certainly do not typify the level of quality that Texans expect from our judicial system,” said Aaron Whitehead, spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas.  ”Ken Paxton, like all Americans, deserves to have his say in a court of law, rather than be judged in a court of public opinion that is presided over by liberal interest groups.”  "
" (CNN) Three Chinese Coast Guard ships entered waters near a chain of islands claimed by both China and Japan in the East China Sea on Monday, according to authorities from both sides. Japan controls the chain and calls them the Senkaku Islands, while China calls them the Diaoyu Islands. The sailing comes just days after US Defense Secretary James Mattis reaffirmed America’s commitment to defending Japan and its disputed islands. According to Japanese broadcaster NHK, protests were lodged with the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo and in Beijing through the Japanese Embassy.  Tensions have flashed numerous times in recent years over the disputed islands, including   between Japanese and Chinese air and naval forces that have been termed dangerous by both sides. EXPLAINER: How an uninhabited island chain split Japan and China, China’s State Oceanic Administration, which oversees the country’s Coast Guard, put out a statement late Monday saying the three ships ”cruised within China’s Diaoyu Islands territorial sea.” China’s Defense Ministry, which is separate from the Oceanic Administration, posted a statement on its website confirming the Coast Guard ship movement.  Japan’s Coast Guard said the Chinese vessels spent two hours in Japanese territorial waters. It was the fourth time Chinese ships have entered Japan’s waters this year, the Japanese Coast Guard said. There were 36 such incidents in 2016, it said. Despite the frequency of the Chinese sailings, experts said having one so soon after Mattis’ visit to Japan sent a subtle message to both Tokyo and Washington. ”It is both a signal that China won’t be intimidated from defending its   and a test to see how the new (Trump) administration responds,” said Carl Schuster, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. Denny Roy, an Asian security expert at the   Center in Honolulu, said ship movements in disputed waters could result in a shooting incident. ”The danger is especially high considering military personnel on both sides are often eager to demonstrate their determination to defend what they consider national territory,” Roy said. And a   military confrontation could bring US forces into play. During a press conference Saturday in Tokyo, Mattis said the US would defend the islands with Japan. ”I made clear that our   policy on the Senkaku Islands stands    the US will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands and as such Article 5 of the   Security Treaty applies,” Mattis said in an appearance with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada. The US position was reinforced Tuesday in a phone call between Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and the new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to a statement from Japan’s Foreign Ministry. ”The United States will be against any unilateral action made to damage the Japanese administration of the Senkaku Islands,” Tillerson stated during the call, according to the Japanese statement. China responded quickly on Saturday to the US stance on the islands, saying it brings instability to the region. ”Diaoyu and its affiliated islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. These are historical facts that cannot be changed. The     security treaty was a product of the Cold War, and it should not harm China’s territorial sovereignty and legitimate rights,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a statement. ”We urge the US side to adopt a responsible attitude and stop making wrong remarks on the issue of the sovereignty of Diaoyu Islands,” Lu said. The US commitment to the Senkakus is not new. In 2014, the Obama administration also said the remote chain fell under the treaty. In late 2013, China declared an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over much of the East China Sea, including the Senkakus, despite objections from Tokyo and Washington. Japan also has an ADIZ over the islands. Although the Senkakus are uninhabited, their ownership would allow for exclusive oil, mineral and fishing rights in the surrounding waters. While the Senkakus remain a source of friction in the   relationship, Mattis’ visit seemed to have soothed relations a bit in another area, the South China Sea. Although the US defense chief said ”China has shredded the trust of nations in the region” by fortifying disputed South China Sea islands, Mattis also said no increased US military maneuvers there were needed. Lu, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, on Monday welcomed that stance. ”As for Mattis’ comment that there is no need for   military operations in the area and the issue should be resolved through diplomacy, these remarks deserve our affirmation,” Lu said.

"Downtown Los Angeles’s iconic punk club, The Smell, could soon face a bitter ending after being served with a demolition notice this past Friday evening, just before Memorial Day weekend. [The   club, which is “open to all ages,” was established in 1998 by owner Jim Smith, who told Breitbart News in a phone interview on Sunday that although he does not yet have the full details of what lies ahead, he’s not giving up on his nearly   venture.  “We are actively putting together a plan and figuring out exactly what we would need to do and how much money we would need to raise and whether or not we could negotiate relocation costs from the landlord. ” Smith said he received the demolition notice on Friday and he posted the note on his personal Facebook page on Saturday:   In an interview with KPCC, Smith noted that The Smell experienced a 70 percent rent increase in a very short period of time. “They raised the rent, like within a month or two. That’s been a little bit of a struggle because they really jacked it up,” Smith reportedly said. “It went from $2, 375 to $4, 000 overnight, so almost a 70 percent increase right there. ” He told KPCC that their building, located at 547 Main Street, was sold to LR Group of Companies about a year ago, and that the new owner has been buying properties and land in the surrounding areas. Businesses in The Smell’s area under LR ownership have reportedly also received similar demolition notices. The Smell relies heavily on volunteers and the $5 cover fee (30 percent of which goes towards staffing and maintenance, while the rest goes to talent). “We have a ton of volunteers that help and book shows and support the place,” Smith said. According to KPCC, the punk club shares the same parcel of land with the New Jalisco, a bar that is also reportedly facing demolition. In addition, according to LAist, there is no information available about the date or plans for the demolition and it will likely take until Tuesday for some information to be provided.

"  Donald Trump is set to impose a range of executive orders immediately after his inauguration on Friday, according to his transition team. [“He’s got a few of them, probably in the area of four or five, that we’re looking at for Friday,” said incoming press secretary Sean Spicer at the Trump transition headquarters.  “Then there are some other ones that I expect him to sign with respect to a couple of issues that have been high on his priority list,” he continued. Trump has promised to reverse a range of orders previously imposed by Barack Obama. The most likely executive order to be repealed on Friday is the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) which grant amnesty to thousands of illegal immigrants. Other orders that will inevitably be repealed on Friday or in the near future include the Clean Power Plan,  as well as orders pertaining to gun control and religious liberty.

"Despite an overall drop in crime, Washington D. C. has nonetheless experienced a whopping 54 percent increase in its murder rate for 2015, the city reports. [At 119 homicides for 2015, the murder rate surpassed that of each of the last four years. 2012 saw only 88 murders, while 2013 hit 104, and 2014 saw 105 murders.  The rise comes desite the fact that the overall crime rate has dropped four percent in the nation’s capital. According to the Washington Times, Assistant Police Chief Peter Newsham blamed the higher murder rate on guns. “A greater percent of those arrested for homicide have prior convictions for felony violent crimes,” Chief Newsham told the paper. “And a lot of times more than one gun was represented at the crime scene. The means either there were two shooters and one victim, or those involved were shooting at each other. ” The chief also said that often police are finding more shell casings littering the ground of crime scenes, so criminals may be using “modified magazines” to be able to shoot up to 40 rounds at a time. Newsham, however, offered no evidence of this, nor did he explain what these modifications might be. D. C.’s rise in homicides is in contrast to the general drop in crime nationwide. Earlier this year, the FBI reported that, in general, the murder rate fell again in 2014, the last year for which statistics are available. With a drop of two percent in violent crimes, 2014 also saw the fewest murders since 2009. Other crimes such as robbery, burglary, theft, and arson also declined. But while the trend in crime was downward in general —  and has been steadily decreasing since the 1980s —  not every area saw a decrease in its homicide rate. Cities such as Chicago, Baltimore, and New York have been hit with a jump in murder rates. After months of rioting this summer, the city of Baltimore has suffered its highest murder rate in years. The number of homicides there has surged to its highest rate since the 1990s with 340 deaths by the end of December. Meanwhile, New York City’s homicide rate is up 20 percent this year. And along with the Big Apple, rising gang violence has reversed the trend of falling murder rates in Chicago, causing homicides in the Windy City to rise to its highest rate in a decade. Even Kansas City has witnessed its highest murder rate since 2011, report say. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston, or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."
"The recent measles outbreak in Minnesota, which was confined to 20 members of the Somali community in Hennepin County, part of the  . Paul metropolitan area, has now spread across the state. [“The Minnesota Department of Health reports the state’s measles outbreak has spread from Hennepin County to Stearns County, totaling 29 cases, marking a new record,” KSTP reports.  “  cases have been confirmed in the Somali community,” KSTP adds. The Minnesota Department of Health added that: “The same number of cases [25] revealed the people affected were unvaccinated. However, in one case, the child had one MMR vaccination. ” MDH reports 28 cases are confirmed in Hennepin County, and one case is in Stearns County. In the past 20 years, 2011 had the most cases with 26 total. The remaining cases have not been verified. All cases are children between the ages of 0 and 5. The city of St. Cloud, located about 65 miles northwest of Minneapolis, is the county seat of Stearns County. Breitbart News asked the Minnesota Department of Health if they could confirm if the four cases of the 29 that were not among the 25 “confirmed in the Somali community” were in the general population not part of the Somali commuity. “No  —   they simply haven’t been verified yet,” a spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health tells Breitbart News. “Most likely Somali. There’s always a bit of a lag pending investigation,” the spokesperson adds. Minnesota Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Ed Ehlinger blamed the measles outbreak on “misinformation” that was provided to the Minnesota Somali community, not on the health practices common in that community. “This outbreak is about unvaccinated children, not specific communities. Unfortunately, the Minnesota Somali community has been targeted with misinformation about vaccine risks. We’re partnering with Somali community leaders and health care providers to counteract that misinformation,” Ehlinger said in a statement released by the Minnesota Department of Health earlier this month. “There are people of all backgrounds around the state who have chosen not to protect themselves or their children. Often that decision is based on good intentions and inaccurate information. It’s the responsibility of all of us who care about the health of Minnesota children to make sure people have accurate information and take action to protect their families and their communities,” Ehlinger added in an additional statement issued by the Minnesota Department of Health on Monday. That statement also specifically addressed the Somali community in Minnesota: MDH also recommends that all Somali Minnesotan children statewide who have already received their first dose of MMR vaccine get their second dose now. This special vaccine schedule is commonly recommended during outbreaks instead of waiting until 4 to 6 years old for the second dose. Parents of Somali Minnesotan children should contact their child’s health care provider and specifically tell them the child needs the MMR vaccine. This may help avoid a longer wait associated with scheduling a routine appointment.  . Paul is home to the largest Somali community in the United States, estimated to be around 70, 000. “Since FY 2002, 100, 246 Somali refugees have resettled in the United States, according to the State Department’s interactive website. Of these, 99. 9 percent, or 99, 909, are Muslim,” Breitbart News reported in December. Assimilation of resettled Somalis in this country has been a significant problem, and continues to be so. In 2016, two Somali refugees, one in a Minnesota mall, the other at Ohio State University, attacked and injured more than 20 Americans. Both refugees were killed by law enforcement during the attacks. On the public health front, Somali refugees in Minnesota have been identified as responsible for 22 percent (161 out of 732) of the cases of active tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed between 2010 and 2014, despite accounting for about one percent of the state’s population, as Breitbart News reported. “Hennepin County  is also the site of two recent cases of active tuberculosis at local public high schools . . . The letter to parents from St. Louis Park Public Schools informing them of the case of active TB in January was sent in three languages: English, Spanish, and Somali, ” as Breitbart News reported. Recently, female genital mutilation (FGM) within the American Somali community has come to the forefront as a significant problem as well. Earlier this month, two doctors and another person were arrested in Livonia, Michigan on charges of conducting illegal FGM procedures on young Somali girls transported from Minnesota. In 2014, the Refugee Womens Health Center in Phoenix, Arizona told NBC News that 98 percent of all Somali women treated there (a total of 247 over five years between 2010 and 2014) were victims of FGM."
" (CNN) Robert Osborne, the film aficionado who shared his knowledge and passion for movies with millions of viewers as the longtime host of Turner Classic Movies, has died. He was 84. ”All of us at Turner Classic Movies are deeply saddened by the death of Robert Osborne,” read a statement from Jennifer Dorian, general manager of Turner Classic Movies. ”He joined us as an expert on classic film and grew to be our cherished colleague and esteemed ambassador for TCM.”  Osborne has been on TCM since it made its   debut in April 1994. A cause of death has not been announced.  Osborne, a Washington native, moved to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting and was once mentored by Lucille Ball, according to an official bio on his website.  His credits included ”The Beverly Hillbillies” and ”The Man with Bogart’s Face.”  He also channeled his love for film into a column for The Hollywood Reporter, called Rambling Reporter, which ran from  . ”Robert was embraced by devoted fans who saw him as a trusted expert and friend,” Dorian added. ”His calming presence, gentlemanly style, encyclopedic knowledge of film history, fervent support for film preservation and highly personal interviewing style all combined to make him a truly   host.”  Osborne was also known for writing several books on the history of the Academy Awards, in addition to his duties as TCM’s primary host.  ”Robert’s contributions were fundamental in shaping TCM into what it is today and we owe him a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid,” Dorian said.

"After the massive   that was the poorly thought out,   executed and   “Against Trump” diatribe last week, “National Review” is apparently still so bitter that on Monday morning another fatal decision was made  —   to attack everyday Americans as stupid homophobes. With conservatives like these, who needs leftists, or the mainstream media? The National Review Online (NRO) lead piece was written by Thurston Howell III Kevin Williamson, titled “Our   Politics” (the title changed later in the day) and puts forth the theory that Donald Trump is winning because the everyday Americans who support the billionaire businessman do not or cannot read. [T]he candidacy of Donald Trump is something that could not happen in a nation that could read. This is the full flower of   politics. Trump supporters are also bigots: Thomas Aquinas cautioned against “homo unius libri,” a warning that would not get very far with the typical Trump voter stuck sniggering over “homo. ” (They’d snigger over “snigger,” too, for similar reasons.) The word “insalubrious” is then used, which I had to look up: Donald Trump is the face of that insalubrious relationship, a lifelong crony capitalist who brags about buying political favors. But his enthusiasts, devoid as they are of a literate politics capable of thinking about all three sides of a triangle at the same time[.] You have to read the whole thing to believe it. Had this published    at Salon, no one would blink an eye. In other words, anyone who believed NRO would be circumspect in the face of last week’s backlash was sorely mistaken. NRO itself has become the very caricature it paints of Trump. All the   publication has is insults as opposed to ideas  —   as though pomposity itself is argument enough. Don’t you understand, if the rubes could quote Thomas Aquinas like us snobs, the rubes would know what is best for them! Apparently it is unforgivable that the hoi polloi are simply too busy going about the business of keeping our world turning to have the time to read “Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire”  too busy fighting our wars, unplugging our toilets, fixing our cars, processing our food, delivering our heating oil, and working three   jobs. The Unwashed have, however, read enough to know that Democrats never do this  —   never attack their own voters like NRO and the rest of the Establishment have this year. But maybe  —   just maybe  —   because they spend all their time in the Real World and not hiding inside NRO’s erudite reading list, the Unwashed also intuitively understand that what NRO and the Establishment have been peddling for five presidential cycles is pure undiluted,   bull shit. The Unwashed might not have read Shakespeare, but they can read a paycheck. The Unwashed might not have read “Capitalism and Freedom,” but they have read a pink slip as their job went overseas or to an exploited illegal immigrant. The Unwashed might not have consumed the same library of Greek and Roman classics (in the original or in translation) but they have consumed years of “Dial 1 for English,” Common Core math problems, terror attacks committed by immigrants, and an Establishment so removed Jeb Bush is being sold as a winner because   …     he  speaks Spanish. The Unwashed might not read a publication that still pines for a Real Conservative, no less than the architect of ObamaCare who has already lost a nationwide presidential election, but they can read a country slipping away into a morass of political correctness, identity politics, and a Republican Party more concerned with the trough that comes with treating illegal immigrants better than America’s working class. NRO simply can’t believe Americans are stupid enough to fall for a slogan like “Make America Great Again. ” Maybe NRO should read more. NRO appears to have been caught off guard by an electorate that isn’t falling for The Establishment’s snake oil this year. Maybe NRO should step out of the Velvet Bubble now and again. The publication that once served up a cup that runneth over with ideas is  now reduced to lashing out with ad hominem  —   not against the Powerful (like Trump) but against the everyday Americans found in William F. Buckley’s fabled phone book. Things really have changed at NRO. Impotent rage is a helluva drug.

"A Czech child abuser has claimed that the UK has failed to deport him to a prison in his home country, in spite of a transfer request by the Czech authorities and his own willingness to go. [In a letter to the Sunday Times, Desan Juran details how both he and his home nation have repeatedly requested the British authorities deport him to serve out his sentence, but have been ignored for over a year.  Juran was working as a nanny in Bradford when he was arrested in connection with a child abuse in his home country. The police later discovered he had shared over 30, 000 indecent images of children online. It is not clear why Juran, who plead guilty to 19 offences involving the sexual abuse of a young boy in the Czech Republic, was not sent home to serve his sentence in the first place. He claims the Czechs have asked the British authorities for more information so they can help to facilitate a transfer, which the Rye Hill inmate requested last June, but “as of now, half a year later, British authorities still have not provided it”. “I am more than willing to go” said Juran. “I know that the British prison system is overcrowded and in crisis, and I believe that getting rid of foreign national prisoners would help solve the problem, and the government wants us to believe that it is its priority. “It is in [the] best interest of [everyone] for me to be repatriated   …     British taxpayers pay tens of thousands of pounds per year for keeping me here. Those six months of waiting   …     have already cost Britain over £15, 000, and I am just one person. There are hundreds, or possibly even thousands of people like me, and if something was done about the inefficiency of British bureaucracy, it would save the taxpayers millions of pounds every year. ” The Telegraph reported that there were more than 4, 000 European Union (EU) nationals in British prisons last September. Only 102 have been transferred to their home countries, despite the introduction of a prisoner transfer directive eight years ago. The number of EU nationals in English and Welsh prisons rose by 240 per cent between 2002 and 2014, costing UK taxpayers around £150m. In June 2016 the BBC reported on an admission by the Parliamentary   of State at the Ministry of Justice  —   removed from office by Theresa May following the Brexit referendum  —   that EU laws “prohibit [the] UK from sending foreign criminals home” even after they have served their sentences. Examples include Romanian rapist Mircea Gheorghiu, whose abusive history was uncovered by the Home Office after a   conviction in the UK. Gheorghiu, who entered the country illegally in 2002, was initially removed under a   deportation scheme, but returned after   judge Sir Nicholas Blake ruled that he was not a sufficiently serious threat and “should be reunited with his family as quickly as possible”."
" (CNN) Abrams book publisher announced this week it will honor the ”Bad Little Children’s Books” author’s request to no longer publish his book, following a social media backlash.     ”Satire can be ugly,” Abrams said in a statement on behalf of the author, writing under the pseudonym Arthur C. Gackley. ”However, the book is clearly not being read by some in the way I had intended  —   as satire  —   and, more disturbingly, is being misread as the very act of hate and bigotry that the work was meant to expose, not promote. For this reason, I have asked ABRAMS to cease publishing the book.”  Abrams did not respond to a CNN request to disclose the identity of the author.  ”Bad Little Children’s Books” is a collection of mock children’s book covers that parody   topics like racism and discrimination. At the center of the controversy is the debate on whether the images portrayed in the book are satire or bigotry? One of the book’s online critics called it ”disgusting and utterly racist.”  One cover titled ”Happy Burkaday Timmy!” portrays a girl in a veil holding a ticking present, while another illustrates the ”Rockets and Missiles of the Islamic State.” A different cover paints a Native American family with the title ”The   Kid and the Gift of the Navajo Blanket Riddled With Smallpox.” Illustrations in the book tackle not only race, but also macabre depictions of death or injury and lewd sexual themes, among others. CNN received a copy of the book directly from Abrams Books. The book’s cover features a yellow strip along the joint made to resemble the gold spine of the classic Little Golden Books    except instead of cute animals and flowers, it has skulls, guns, bombs and knives. On the front, the book says it contains parodies, spoofs and ”offensively tweaked covers.” Bigotry or satire? Though it was released in September, the book was thrust into the limelight Friday after the   news blog Book Riot excoriated the tittle for its ”racist, xenophobic and religious bigotry” themes. ”There comes a point when ’funny’ becomes   hate and when that hate is   racist,” wrote former librarian, author and blogger Kelly Jensen. ”This ’humor’ adds to the misinformation, adds to the hatred, and ultimately, makes living in this society more frustrating, difficult, and dangerous for so many. And this ’humor’ is the kind of garbage that needs to be eliminated at all levels, particularly in publishing,” she wrote.  After a Twitterstorm calling for Abrams Books to recall the tittle, the publisher issued a statement Saturday standing by ”Bad Little Children’s Books.” But come Sunday, Abrams Books backpedaled. The publisher defended the book’s publication but said it would respect the author’s request and suspend future publications.   ”Some reviewers and commenters on social media have taken elements of the book at face value, which, we believe, misses the point of the book as a work of artistic parody and satire,” read a company statement, released via Twitter. ”Its intention is to shine a spotlight on stereotypes about race, gender, and difference that have become commonplace in today’s world and to, in fact, skewer all levels of societal bias.” A spokesman for the Council on   Relations, Ibrahim Hooper, called that statement a ”wild” claim. ”It is probably wild that they claim it is to expose intolerance and bigotry,” Hooper said. ”I think it had the opposite effect of promoting it and exploiting it. Bottom line is they have the right to publish this kind of material, but should they? And I think given the divisions we have seen in our society I don’t think it is the best use of the First Amendment.” Freedom of speech, Freedom of speech and responsibility are not mutually exclusive, argued Hooper. He called for tolerance and mutual understanding instead of the ”promotion of hatred and division.” In a public letter, the National Coalition Against Censorship came to Abrams’ defense, asserting ”free expression and intellectual freedom.”  ”We urge the company not to accede to pressure to withdraw the book, but to stand for the proposition that it is the right of authors to write as they choose and of individuals to decide for themselves what to read. After all, anyone who doesn’t like the book doesn’t have to buy it,” the NCAC said in its letter. Abrams President Michael Jacobs sits on the Board of Directors of NCAC.   A ’fine line’ of satire, Satire and bigotry are not mutually exclusive, said Jason Steed, a Texas Supreme Court and appellate attorney and former English professor. He has written about the role humor plays in identity, most recently during the US election. ”We use humor socially to figure out who we fit in with and what groups we are excluded from,” Steed told CNN. He gave the example of two white people making a racist joke while a black person is in the room. ”The two white people can assimilate while alienating the black person. What is the humor doing? People who are offended will feel alienated by the humor. If we find it funny, we are assimilating with the group who is assimilating with the joke,” he explained. Satire however, can get complicated, warns Steed.  ”The humor may not mean to be racist but to mock racism, and that may be some of what they (Abrams) are trying to get at. You push it to some kind of extreme,” he said. But ”there may be a fine line with trying to make a point with satire and really hurting a lot of people. Everyone needs to figure out where the line is and decide what it means to be responsible.”"
"In a new survey, a   organization called PRRI put an interesting spin on the traditional “right track, wrong track” polling question by asking if “American culture and way of life have changed for the worse or better since the 1950s. ” It turns out a slim majority think the Fifties were better, by 51% to 48%. [This is a new angle because pollsters usually ask if the country is on the “wrong track” without giving a specific example of what the “right track” would look like. They ask if the country is getting “worse” in some general sense, without asking the respondents to imagine what “better” would look like.  The standard     question was asked, too, and 74% said America is “seriously off on the wrong track, a much higher level of pessimism than PRRI found in 2012. The poll’s internals put the question in the context of the current election by noting that 72% of declared Donald Trump supporters thought American “society and way of life” have changed for the worse over the past 60 years, while a comparable percentage of Hillary Clinton’s voters (70%) say they have changed for the better.  Racial and class divisions were visible in the responses as well.   percent of black respondents and 57% of Hispanics said things have gotten better since the Fifties, while 56% of whites said the reverse. However, 56% of   whites said better, while 65% of “white   Americans” said worse. White evangelical Protestants reportedly had the most dour view of social evolution since the Fifties, with 74% of them saying culture has changed for the worse. Those who feel American culture and politics have taken a wrong turn expressed a strong sense of frustration and alienation in various other poll questions.   percent of poll respondents endorsed the notion of “a leader who is willing to break some rules, if that’s what it takes to set things right,” with 55% of declared Republicans supporting that idea.   percent of respondents said neither major party represents their views any more, a   increase since 1990. Clinton and Trump both have historically low approval ratings for presidential candidates, although Clinton fares better on most attributes.   percent said big money has so much influence on elections that their vote scarcely matters. Only 43% of respondents expressed a great deal of confidence that their votes would be counted accurately. (In an interesting side note to that last dismal statistic, respondents were evenly divided about whether illegal voters, or eligible voters unfairly denied the right to vote, were a more serious problem, but only 9% thought “voter apathy” was the biggest problem with American elections. The media and political class thinks voter apathy is a much bigger problem than the actual electorate does.) To be sure, the terms in many of these questions are highly subjective. “Since the 1950s, do you think American culture and way of life has mostly changed for the better, or has it mostly changed for the worse?” is a very big question, especially given that many of the poll respondents weren’t around during the Fifties and Sixties.  Younger people on the Left side of the American political spectrum are generally given a negative view of the Fifties, especially with respect to racism and stodgy, judgmental “Ozzie and Harriet” culture, while the late Sixties are seen as a mystical transformative experience. Young people on the Right are more likely to hear about the virtues of those earlier times, or to be concerned about modern trends in divorce, illegitimacy, and   career anxiety. Both the good and bad things happened, of course, but a holistic view of a  ’s worth of culture will depend on emphasis. It seems likely that if most people on the Right were asked what “going back to the Fifties” would mean, they’d talk about restoring family and community values, strengthening the rule of law, and shoring up the economy for   people, but they wouldn’t want to repeal the Civil Rights Act. On the other hand, ask the average campus liberal what going back to the Fifties means, and “turning back the clock” on civil rights, or gay rights, will be a common, contemptuous response.  It’s curious to think that our supposedly tolerant friends on the Left would take pleasure in the notion of white Christians feeling marginalized and frustrated, as such a poll suggests. Shouldn’t Utopia have a place for them, too? Even if they were a tiny minority, shouldn’t their views be respected in a vibrant and healthy Republic? (  question: how many generations do they have to be marginalized and powerless before they’re no longer considered “oppressors” who can be discriminated against with abandon by our political system?) There will be a temptation for liberals to denounce this Republican affection for the Fifties as incoherent, dreamy nostalgia, but there are plenty of social indicators that are empirically worse today. We should be able to preserve what’s good about the present without abandoning the wisdom of the past, on subjects where the “wrong track” can be mapped with hard, cold statistics. Another debatable assertion is that support for a leader “willing to break some rules, if that’s what it takes to set things right” equals an embrace of “authoritarianism,” as PRRI puts it. For one thing, that’s not the definition of authoritarianism. A nation can sink very far into authoritarian hell under leadership that doesn’t actually break its own rules. More to the point, we’re emerging from eight years under a leader, President Barack Obama, who most certainly does believe he should “break some rules, if that’s what it takes to set things right. ” It’s the defining characteristic of his presidency. He’s come very close to using those exact words on many occasions, when pushing his notion of a unitary executive who shouldn’t have to put up with “gridlock” and “obstructionism,” no matter what the rules say, including the Constitution.  Some Republicans who responded positively to the idea of a leader who breaks the rules to do what’s right are merely asking for leadership that fights on Obama’s terms, or accepting that Obama’s actions have permanently redefined the role of the President.  Conversely, very few Obama supporters would agree that his “breaking the rules to set things right” makes him an authoritarian. If the   contest leads to a great national bipartisan conversation on the evils of authoritarianism, it will have a silver lining. Take all the responses from the PRRI poll together, and we might form a hypothesis that much of the “wrong track” feeling that grips American voters stems from their sense of helplessness, their anger at a   system that doesn’t represent their interests, or grant them the independence to make their own decisions.  People on the Left and Right have very different ideas about who the masters of that system are, and those differences make meaningful political cooperation difficult. We should have the wisdom to agree that claiming America has made no major mistakes since the Fifties is as absurd as claiming it has done nothing right. "
" (CNN) A strong storm is expected to bring drenching rain and the threat of flash flooding and landslides to Southern California late Friday and through the weekend, the National Weather Service warned Thursday.  Flood watches affecting more than 20 million people have been posted for the southern portion of the state, including Los Angeles and San Diego. The widespread watches extend into the foothills of the southern Sierra. The most rainfall is expected to hit Friday evening, with up to 6 inches possible in just six hours along the coast and in the valleys of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties.  ”The storm looks to be the strongest storm to hit southwest California this season. It is likely the strongest within the last six years and possibly even as far back as December 2004 or January 1995,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said.  Oroville Dam spillway still a concern, While Southern Californians will be seeing the bulk of their rain before the end of the weekend, those in Northern California can expect heavier rain late Sunday and into Monday.  The weather brings more worries for communities south of the stricken Oroville Dam, with rainfall continuing over the next seven days that could total more than 12 inches. Authorities ordered mandatory evacuations over concerns that an emergency spillway at the dam could fail and threaten nearby communities.  On Tuesday, officials downgraded the evacuation order to a warning, allowing 188, 000 evacuees from Butte, Sutter and Yuba counties to return home. ”The next week of storms could potentially bring hundreds of billions of gallons of water into Lake Oroville, adding pressure back onto the already compromised structure of the concrete spillway and emergency spillway next to Oroville Dam,” CNN Senior Meteorologist Dave Hennen said. ”The main spillway is pumping out 100, 000 cubic feet of water per second . .. so we still have much more water going out than coming in. We’re cautiously optimistic,” state fire department spokesman Jay Smith said. Officials say residents south of the dam should stay alert and up to date as the rains pass through the area. Storm to take a bite out of  drought, The heavy rainfall also is expected to further alleviate drought conditions that have plagued California since late 2013.  It’s the latest in a string of potent winter storms that lashed Northern, and more recently Southern California, erasing the worst of the historic drought. In addition to bringing abundant rainfall these storms have dumped massive amounts of snow in the Sierra Nevadas, a boon to local ski resorts, which have suffered for several years with   snowfall."
" (CNN) Donald Trump’s doctor told CNN in an interview he stands by the letter he wrote for the Republican nominee vouching for his good health and has no regrets about being embroiled in the controversy over it. When asked if Trump has the physically capability of being president, Dr. Harold Bornstein told CNN’s Drew Griffin on Thursday, ”Absolutely, no question about it.” Bornstein, a    New York City gastroenterologist, has been Trump’s physician for more than three decades and came under scrutiny for an unusual letter he wrote in 2015 describing Trump’s physical health, which other doctors have said includes strange wording, medically incorrect terms and an unprofessional conclusion. Trump’s lab ”test results were astonishingly excellent,” he wrote, mimicking the grandiose verbiage of his  . ”If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Bornstein told CNN that he was rushed for time when writing the letter since he had patients to see.  ”The only thing I wanted to do in my life is practice with my father, which I managed to do for 35 years.”   RELATED: Trump’s doctor: Trump ’will be healthiest individual ever elected’ president, Bornstein told CNN that his father started his medical practice at the same Park Avenue office location in 1947.  Trump was first under the care of his father Dr. Jacob Bornstein, according to the letter. Harold Bornstein joined the practice in 1980, and when his father passed away in 2010, continued it. When asked if he had any regrets about getting involved in the presidential election, Bornstein said, ”No. My patients, I take care of them the right way.” The CNN interview was cut short when Dr. Bornstein’s wife approached, and covered the camera with her hand. Bornstein had warned it might happen. ”My wife will come back, she’ll get angry,” he said as the interview began. At least four medical malpractice lawsuits have been filed against Dr. Harold Bornstein in the state of New York dating back to 1986. In a 1999 lawsuit, New York resident Kenneth Levin accused Bornstein of negligence in failing to properly diagnose and treat his wife by ”overmedicating” her with prescription drugs and not following proper medical procedures, which Levin argued led to her death. The case argues Bornstein ”prescribed unnecessary barbiturates and other drugs to the decedent with full knowledge that these medications were not necessary” and that some were ”greatly in excess of appropriate dosages.” RELATED: Clinton’s health is fine, but what about Trump? Bornstein denied the allegations and settled the case in 2002 for $86, 000 with no finding of liability. Another case charged both Bornstein and his father of recklessness in overdosing and improperly performing a colonoscopy on Vincent Pollifrone, which the case argued led to his death in 2000. The case was disposed in 2006, after the defendants denied the claims. The plaintiff’s lawyer in that case, Joseph Miklos, told CNN the parties signed a confidentiality agreement so he could not discuss the terms of any settlement. When asked about the lawsuits Thursday, Bornstein defended his credentials and said the number of malpractice suits he has faced is ”normal.” Professor David Studdert of Stanford University, an expert on health law who has tracked data on medical malpractice lawsuits, said gastroenterologists such as Bornstein have about a 10% chance of facing a new medical malpractice suit each year. ”Over a career, it would be the norm rather than the exception that a gastroenterologist would have a few claims filed against him. That’s not an outlier situation,” Studdert said. Dr. G Kevin Donovan, a bioethicist at Georgetown University Medical School, agrees that the existence of four disposed malpractice suits does not provide enough information to draw conclusions about Bornstein, but he said Bornstein’s letter describing Trump’s health is light on detail and heavy on bombast. RELATED: Trump’s health care plan: What he promises and what it really says  Donovan said most physicians ”don’t use that kind of hyperbole for a medical statement.” Donovan added that most letters written by doctors for presidential candidates contain a level of subjectivity since candidates select the doctors who write their assessments and can stipulate what information they include. ”They can only tell us what the candidate allows them to reveal,” Donovan said, adding, ”Is it likely that a candidate would go to a physician that would not speak well of them?” Former patients and a classmate of Bornstein reached by CNN described him as competent yet eccentric. New York resident Roger Friedman, who said he was a patient of Bornstein’s in the 80’s and early 90’s, said he was surprised when he recently heard Bornstein had treated Trump for decades. ”He was a good doctor but he was peculiar, disorganized, and not at the level you expect for a billionaire,” Friedman said.  Angelina Kaiserman, a New York jeweler who told CNN she has been in Bornstein’s care for more than 20 years, said, ”Honestly I give him five stars.” Dr. Edward Hurwitz, who attended medical school with Bornstein at Tufts University in the class of 1975, remembers Bornstein making sarcastic comments in class and often writing elaborate poems with colorful language he would share with friends. ”He was snide with his comments but he was certainly smart,” Hurwitz said."
" (CNN) Forget clairvoyants, fortune tellers or tarot cards: If you have a burning desire to know how far you are along life’s path, this online quiz claims to be able to provide an estimate. The quiz, on the website ”Ubble” (a nickname for UK Longevity Explorer) is designed for UK residents aged between 40 and 70 years old. It estimates participants’ risk of dying in the next five years, then sees how that risk aligns to UK age averages to give an ”Ubble age.” ”So for example, if you’re a    woman and your estimated risk of dying in five years is 2. 4% the most similar risk in the UK life tables is of a    woman. So your Ubble age would be 56,”    of the quiz, Erik Ingelsson, said in an article on The Conversation.  Designed by Swedish researchers Andrea Ganna and Ingelsson, the quiz is based on a UK Biobank study of 500, 000 people and published in the ”Lancet” medical journal. It’s ”the largest study of this kind in the world, with a very broad range of different measurements that allow you to do this kind of analysis,” Ingelsson told CNN. An assessment of 655 variables of demographics, health, and lifestyle led to the identification of the strongest mortality predictors by a computer program, with 13 questions set for men, and 11 for women.  Participants are asked whether they smoke, if they have ever been diagnosed with cancer, heart disease or diabetes, how many people they live with, how many cars they own, and whether their walking place is brisk, slow or if they never walk. ”I think it’s important to point out that we’re not saying that any of these questions are causal factors,” Ingelsson said. ”So the question about the number of vehicles . .. I think it’s a proxy for   status. That’s my guess.” He emphasized that hundreds of variables are contained within the few questions. Although some of the questions are similar for men and women, Ingelsson said, others, such as the number of children one has, were specific to women.  And researchers say the quiz is a better forecaster of death than physical measures, such as blood pressure. ”I do think that’s one of the most interesting finds of this study, that is highlighted in the ’Lancet’ paper, is that simple questions were doing a better job than quite dedicated, specific measurements.” One of its advantages is that the questions take into account many different factors, Ingelsson said. But he added, ”the conclusion of our study is definitely not that you stop measuring these things. But quite surprisingly enough, it doesn’t improve the risk prediction of beyond the questions.”  At the end of the quiz, you can see how your responses affected your estimated risk of death. But the quiz won’t tell you how to change your lifestyle. ”If you buy one more car, that won’t make you live longer, for example,” said Ingelsson. ”Or if you walk faster, that won’t prolong your life either.”  Ingelsson, a professor at Uppsala University in Sweden said that while the data could be important for health professionals and researchers, further tests would be needed before the quiz could be used by medical professionals. And what if you’re distressed by the findings of the quiz?  A disclaimer at the bottom of the website’s homepage clarifies that it doesn’t offer a medical or professional service and such information needs to be sought elsewhere.  ”If it raises some specific concerns then people should see their healthcare professional,” said Ingelsson. ”But I think the risk of that is relatively low, because most people are quite aware of their own health already.”"

" (CNN) The video appears to give us a rare glimpse into a police officer’s reaction after the fatal shooting of an unarmed man. Officer Grant Morrison approaches a patrol car and collapses. Fellow officers help him up, and he keels over the hood of the car, face in hand, sobbing.  ”I thought he was going to pull a gun on me,” Morrison, an officer in Billings, Montana, tells one of the officers assisting him.  Since Missouri teen Michael Brown’s death prompted a move to put body cameras on all of America’s policeman, Americans will likely witness more recordings of the crucial moment when an officer decides to pull the trigger.  It’s ugly, as a dash cam from Morrison’s patrol car reminds us. The video was presented as part of a coroner’s inquest into the April shooting of Richard Ramirez.  A squad car’s headlights shine on Morrison as he walks away from a dark driveway in the background, where he had pulled over a car carrying Ramirez, who Morrison thought was a suspect in an armed robbery and shooting. Morrison shot the man after he did not comply with orders to keep his hands in sight, dash cam video shows. When Morrison reaches his fellow officer’s squad car    with its dash cam also running    he keels forward to the ground. He’s not wounded, but he sounds as though he’s hyperventilating. Morrison had just learned Ramirez, whom he shot three times, was unarmed. Morrison appears to sob when he stands back up, his voice squelching when he tells a colleague he thought his life was in danger.  A colleague holds tight to Morrison as he appears to cry in heaves doubled over on the hood of the car. Another officer asks Morrison if she should call his wife. It was the second time the drug enforcement officer had shot and killed someone.  Both times, dash cams were rolling. Both times Morrison faced an inquiry and the shootings were ruled justifiable, partly based on testimony analyzing the video, according to local media reports. In Ramirez’s case, Morrison said he was facing a suspected armed robber and shooter who he thought might pull a gun on him, CNN affiliate KULR reported.  ”I wish I just knew he didn’t have a gun but I couldn’t take the risk,” Morrison told a court earlier this month. ”I couldn’t take the risk of him having a gun. I wanted to go home to my family and I wanted to see my son grow up.” Despite the emotional breakdown    and despite the inquest clearing Morrison of wrongdoing    responses to a message posted by the Billings police chief on Facebook indicate there are plenty who feel Morrison used excessive force.  ”He started out dropping   at the guy and then drew his pistol. He barely gave the guy a chance to surrender before plugging him three times at point blank range. This policeman is a murderer plain and simple,” Tony Galasso wrote.  ”Even a blind man can see (and hear) that this was wrongdoing on the coward cop’s part. He was all jacked up as soon as he got to the car. Swearing and yelling. He clearly knew who the guy he shot was and wanted to shoot him by the sound of his voice,” Art Sharrard wrote.  One person even invoked the     murder trial in Florida, in which Michael Dunn was convicted of murder, despite his claim that he saw a gun and acted in  .  ”It’s odd that Michael Dunn was convicted for murder in the first degree of Jordan Davis, even as his claim to   against an imaginary weapon was nearly identical to Morrison’s,” Troy Crumbo wrote.  Morrison and the Billings police had their supporters, too.  ”Folks, when a cop stops you, it’s not about you. It’s about law and order. Help out. Do what you’re told,” Mona Letourneau responded, while Bryce Saunders posted, ”Well said, Chief!! Thanks for all you and your Department do for the Citizens of Billings keeping everyone safe.” The other shooting involving Morrison happened in February 2013 in front of a suspected drug house. A man reached for a gun in his pocket. It turned out to be a BB gun, the Billings Gazette reported after the inquiry. That incident was also caught on video, and on it, you can hear Morrison and another man escalating into a shouting match.  ”Get on the ground now!” Morrison yells. ”I’m going to (expletive) shoot you!” The male voice continues shouting at the officer, who keeps commanding him to get onto the ground. There’s a pulsating electric sound    perhaps a Taser    then a bang that sounds like a gunshot.  ”You shot him?” a woman’s voice later asks.  ”He had a gun in pocket,” Morrison answers.  ”He had a BB gun,” she yells.  ”I didn’t know that,” Morrison responds. The man later died of his wounds. Opinion: Police body cams: Will they really help?"

"’  ’ ’   Republican Donald Trump on Wednesday entered the final phase of   his   search for a running mate, arranging     meetings with his finalists and family members as his staff   prepares for a Friday announcement. ’ ’   Trump, his adult children, and key staffers huddled with one of   the prospects. ’ ”   He began the day with breakfast at the residence of one, Gov.   Mike Pence of Indiana, on Wednesday morning, a day after the two   campaigned together in the state. They were joined by Trump’s   three adult children, along with his    and his campaign   chair Paul Manafort, who were seen leaving the residence. ” ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tI will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow. ’t’t’ ”   Hours later, Newt Gingrich, another finalist, was seen with   Trump’s entourage at a downtown Indianapolis hotel. Sen. Jeff   Sessions of Alabama, who has been advising Trump, was spotted   arriving at the same hotel not long after Gingrich left. ” ”   Trump’s family, including Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared   Kushner, also met privately with Gov. Chris Christie of New   Jersey on Tuesday. The meeting was confirmed by a source with   direct knowledge of the meeting who was not authorized to discuss   it publicly. ” ”   The meetings have been designed to let Trump’s family get to know   the candidates better before the presumptive nominee formalizes   his decision. ” ”   Trump had originally planned to fly back from Indiana with Pence   after a rally Tuesday night, but his plane was grounded by   mechanical issues, so Trump’s kids flew to join them in Indiana,   another person familiar with his movements but who was not   authorized to discuss them said. ” ’   ”It was a late plan,” Pence told reporters later Wednesday. ”I   was hauling dishes from the cupboard at midnight. (His wife)   Karen laid out a nice spread.” ’ ”   Indiana is a state with particular significance for the   presumptive GOP nominee: It’s where he effectively locked up the   GOP nomination with a commanding primary win that drove former   rival Ted Cruz from the race. ” ”   Pence, Chris Christie, and Gingrich were said to be the final   contenders for   candidate on the Republican   ticket less than a week before the GOP meets in Cleveland for the   formal nomination. That’s according to a person familiar with   Trump’s thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity because the   person was not authorized to discuss the vetting process. Trump   said in a Tuesday interview with The Wall Street Journal that   Sessions, Trump’s top Senate advocate, was also still in the mix. ” ’  ’ ”   Pence is a steady, staunch conservative who would help calm   nervous Republican wary of Trump’s impulsive style. Gingrich is a   boisterous   who has spent decades in Washington,   including as House speaker. Christie, a   rival, has   become one of Trump’s most trusted advisers. ” ’   Trump has spent weeks consulting with friends and family as he   weighs the most important decision of his campaign to date. He   has also brought his finalists on tour, having them opening for   him at speeches and rallies to test their receptions before his   crowds. ’ ’   ”It’’s a little bit like ’’The Apprentice,’’” Gingrich, the former   House Speaker, said in a Tuesday interview with Fox News. ”You   find out sooner or later who the last one standing is.” ’ ’   Trump appeared reluctant to commit on Wednesday. ”I’’m narrowing   it down. I mean I’’m at three, potentially four. But in my own   mind, I probably am thinking about two,” he told Fox News’’ Bret   Baier. ’ ”   Introducing Trump at a rally in Westfield, Indiana, on Tuesday   evening, Pence received an enthusiastic reception as he compared   Trump to Republican icon Ronald Reagan and dug into Trump’s   likely Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. ” ’   Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday he was looking for   a ”fighter skilled in    combat” as his      but hadn’’t seen enough of Pence to measure his   fight. ’ ’   While Trump kept his cards close, he spoke playfully of Pence at   the rally: ”I don’’t know whether he’’s going to be your governor   or your vice president.” ’ ’   Pence told reporters Wednesday he was ”honored by the attention”   and the ”opportunity to get to know this good man and his   family.” ’ ’   ”There’’s a number of other and noteworthy Americans that they’’re   considering and I’’m just honored to be on that list,” he said. ’ ’  ’ ”   Pence and Gingrich would be welcome picks among anxious   Republican officials already gathering in Cleveland for next   week’s convention. Their governing experience and popularity   among the party’s conservative base would mark a sharp contrast   to Trump, whose brand of politics has alienated     conservatives and establishment Republicans alike. ” ’   Trump’’s team has been building hype for the decision, including   in a text message to supporters that urged recipients to sign up   to receive an early notification of the choice. Fox News added to   the speculation Tuesday when it said it had suspended its   contributor agreement with Gingrich ”due to the intense media   speculation” about his potential to join Trump’’s ticket. ’ ”   Less than an hour later, Gingrich appeared on the network and   suggested that Trump’s decision was imminent. ” ’   ”My guess is you’’re going to hear either tomorrow or Thursday,”   Gingrich said. ’ ’     ’ ’   Colvin reported from Washington.

"RALEIGH, N. C.  —   In the feverishly manicured spectacle that is electoral politics, there are few distractions quite as imposing to candidates as a small child. Just this week, Donald J. Trump earned a wave of negative headlines after he confronted a crying baby at a rally in Virginia. Mike Pence learned that lesson the hard  —   and perhaps revealing  —   way at a rally here on Thursday morning when he solicited a question from an    boy, Matthew Schricker. “I’ve been watching the news lately, and I’ve been noticing that you’ve been kind of softening up on Mr. Trump’s policies and words,” Matthew said skeptically. “Is this going to be your role in the administration?” Mr. Pence stood   for a moment before offering an uneasy chuckle. “What did you say I’ve been doing?” Mr. Pence asked over laughter from the crowd. “You’ve been kind of softening up on his words,” Matthew steadfastly replied. Many political analysts far Matthew’s senior have been pondering the same thought. In the past week and a half, Mr. Pence has taken divergent stances from (or cleaned up after) his running mate on a series of issues, including the possibility of Russia’s hacking Hillary Clinton’s email, the treatment of the Khan family and the candidacy of Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Pence tried to regain his footing by complimenting his interlocutor. “No. 1, this boy has a future,” Mr. Pence pronounced. “Nicely done. ” After predicting that Matthew would one day be governor of North Carolina, Mr. Pence tried to fill the gaps between some of his positions and those of his more bombastic running mate by attributing their differences to manner rather than matter. “Sometimes things don’t always come out like you mean, right?” Mr. Pence said. “And Donald Trump and I are absolutely determined to work together and we have different styles, you might have noticed that. ” Then Mr. Pence added, in a typical stroke of   that has become a necessary weapon in his campaign arsenal, “You know, I said at our convention, I said we’d nominated someone who is larger than life, known for charisma, so they wanted to kind of balance the ticket. ” Mr. Pence said he wanted to make one thing clear to his young skeptic. “Differences in style, Matthew, should never be confused with differences in conviction,” he said. “And I will tell you right now Donald Trump has the right vision for America, he has the right policies for America and I’m going to fight every day to tell his story all across the United States. ” Matthew seemed persuaded. “I was a little worried about him, and I just wanted to make sure he was totally loyal to Mr. Trump and the Republican Party,” Matthew said after the event had ended. “And now I think he is. ” At future gatherings, Mr. Pence may wish to pick on someone his own size."

"Roger Wilkins, who championed civil rights for black Americans for five decades as an official in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, a foundation executive, a journalist, an author and a university professor, died on Sunday in Kensington, Md. He was 85. His daughter Elizabeth confirmed his death, at a care facility. The cause was complications of dementia. A black lawyer in the corridors of power, Mr. Wilkins was an assistant United States attorney general, ran domestic programs for the Ford Foundation, wrote editorials for The Washington Post and The New York Times, taught history at George Mason University for nearly 20 years and was close to leading lights of literature, music, politics, journalism and civil rights. Roy Wilkins, who led the N. A. A. C. P. from 1955 to 1977, was his uncle. Roger Wilkins’s early mentor was Thurgood Marshall, the renowned civil rights lawyer who became the Supreme Court’s first black associate justice. And he organized Nelson Mandela’s triumphant   visit to the United States in 1990 as millions turned out to see that living symbol of resistance to apartheid after his release from 27 years in prison in South Africa. Beyond attending a segregated elementary school as a boy and being arrested once in a protest against apartheid, Mr. Wilkins had little personal experience with discrimination. He waged war against racism from above the barricades  —   with political influence, jawboning, court injunctions, philanthropic grants, legislative proposals, and commentaries on radio and television and in newspapers, magazines and books. Outwardly, he was a successful, popular black man with more white acquaintances than black friends. The second of his three wives was white. A lean, intense,   intellectual, he grew up in a genteel   family. The customs, attitudes and social currencies of everyday black life “evolved away from me,” he said in a memoir. “I didn’t know how to talk, to banter, to move my body,” he said. It mattered. As he rose to prominence, he came to regard himself as a token black in institutions and social circles that were overwhelmingly white and privileged. It troubled him deeply. In the memoir, “A Man’s Life: An Autobiography” (1982) he cited struggles with depression, suicidal thoughts and drinking problems, and acknowledged years of unease with his blackness, of trying to live up to the expectations of whites. “Instead of standing with my nose pressed to the window, I often found myself inside rooms with people whose names were Mailer, Vidal, Javits, Kennedy or Bernstein,” he wrote. He was surrounded at work by   white men, while “my night world was virtually ” he added. “It was as if, by entering that world at night, I was betraying everything I told myself I stood for during the day. ” A University of Michigan Law School graduate, Mr. Wilkins went to Washington on a wave of New Frontier fervor in 1962 to join the Kennedy administration. He became special assistant to the head of the Agency for International Development. He was soon spotted as a savvy, if outspoken, Democratic asset, and joined campaigns for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson named him the administration’s chief troubleshooter on urban racial issues. He became an assistant attorney general, ostensibly to calm the unrest racking cities. He spoke dutifully against violence and met mayors and community leaders, but did not see his principal task as the suppression of disturbances. “I am a firm believer in the view that the riots are not the real problem,” Mr. Wilkins said, calling for more jobs, housing and help for the poor. “The real threat to American life is our inattention to the really depressed and anguished conditions of the minority group people who live in the ghettos of this country. ” In 1966, he and a Justice Department colleague went to Chicago to see the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As he admitted later, Mr. Wilkins harbored suspicions that Dr. King might be an opportunist, Louis Menand wrote in The New Yorker in 2013. The visitors found Dr. King in an airless railroad flat in a slum, talking to 40 or 50 young gang members about nonviolence. “For hours this went on,” Mr. Wilkins was quoted as saying. “There were no photographers there, no newsmen. There was no glory in it. He also kept two assistant attorneys general of the United States waiting for hours while he did this. ” It was 4 a. m. when Dr. King finished. He woke his wife, Coretta, and she made coffee. “We sat and we talked,” Mr. Wilkins said. “He was a great man, a great man. ” When Richard M. Nixon became president in early 1969, Mr. Wilkins detected a “turning away from the paths of cultural decency” and left government to join the Ford Foundation in New York. For three years, he oversaw funding for job training, education, drug rehabilitation and other programs. But he was powerless to support many projects he considered worthy and became disillusioned with the work. In 1972 he began a new career in journalism, writing editorials for The Washington Post. He also began to put aside what he called his “desperate search for white approval. ” His editorials on the Watergate scandal that drove Nixon from the presidency, along with reporting by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and cartoons by Herbert Block, helped The Post win the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1973. Mr. Wilkins joined The Times editorial board in 1974 and later became an   page columnist. In 1977, he and other minority journalists accused The Times in a federal lawsuit of racial discrimination in hiring and promotions the case was settled for cash and pledges of improvements. He left the newspaper in 1979 and was an associate editor and columnist for The Washington Star in 1980 and 1981. From 1979 to 1989 he was a member of the board that awarded journalism’s Pulitzer Prizes. He was also on an advisory panel that recommended Janet Cooke of The Washington Post for a   Pulitzer in 1981, for her article on an    heroin addict. It was exposed as a fabrication after she won the prize. He said the episode had harmed “blacks in newsrooms all over the country. ” Ms. Cooke, who returned the prize and resigned, is black. From 1982 to 1992, Mr. Wilkins was a senior fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a Washington think tank. From 1988 until his retirement in 2007, he was the Clarence J. Robinson professor in history and American culture at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. During his teaching years, he wrote for newspapers and magazines and was a frequent commentator on radio and television. Roger Wilkins was born in Kansas City, Mo. on March 25, 1932, to Earl and Helen Jackson Wilkins. Some of his ancestors were slaves in Virginia. His father was a journalist and his mother was the first black national president of the Y. W. C. A. she helped desegregate the organization in the 1960s. In Kansas City, Roger attended the   Crispus Attucks School, founded in 1893 and named for a slave killed by the British in the Boston Massacre of 1770. After his father died in 1941, the boy and his mother joined relatives in Harlem, and three years later settled in Grand Rapids, Mich. where he graduated from high school. At the University of Michigan, he earned a bachelor’s degree in 1953 and a law degree in 1956. He tried social work in Cleveland briefly, practiced law in New York City for several years, then joined the Kennedy administration. Mr. Wilkins had a home in Washington. His marriages to Eve Tyler and Mary Myers ended in divorce. His third wife, Patricia A. King, a law professor at Georgetown University, survives him. Besides her and his daughter Elizabeth, from his third marriage, he is survived by another daughter, Amy Wilkins, and a son, David, both from his first marriage two half sisters, Sharon Peters and Judith Claytor and two grandsons. Mr. Wilkins wrote “Jefferson’s Pillow: The Founding Fathers and the Dilemma of Black Patriotism” (2001). He produced and narrated two PBS documentaries, “Keeping the Faith” (1987) about black churches, and “Throwaway People” (1990) about a poor black neighborhood. “In a sense,” Mr. Wilkins wrote in his memoir, “I have been an explorer, and I sailed as far out into the white world as a black man of my generation could sail. ”"
" (CNN) Country music star Little Jimmy Dickens, a fixture at the Grand Ole Opry for decades, died Friday of cardiac arrest after having a stroke on Christmas, the website for the famed music venue reported.  Dickens, 94, died at a hospital in Nashville, according to media reports.  ”It is with a heavy heart that I say goodbye to my hero and friend today. I loved you Jimmy,” Brad Paisley wrote on Twitter. Dickens joined the Opry, the showcase for country music, in 1948. ”The Grand Ole Opry did not have a better friend than Little Jimmy Dickens,” Opry Vice President and General Manager Pete Fisher said in a statement.  ”He loved the audience and his Opry family, and all of us loved him back. He was a    entertainer and a great soul whose spirit will live on for years to come.” Dickens    known for his diminutive stature, colorful   jackets and keen sense of humor    had several novelty hits, beginning in 1949. ”May The Bird Of Paradise Fly Up Your Nose,” ”Out Behind the Barn,” and ”Take An Old Cold Tater (And Wait)” are among his fans’ favorite tunes. Another is ”I’m Little, But I’m Loud.” The     artist was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1983.  He is survived by his wife, Mona Dickens, and two daughters. ”I am deeply saddened. We have lost  a precious treasure,” tweeted Charlie Daniels.  The Opry’s news release said plans were still being formed for a funeral, as well as a public viewing and service.  Dickens was born in Bolt, West Virginia, the oldest of 13 children. In 2007 he told West Virginia Public Broadcasting that while his dad was a coal miner and the family was poor, they were never hungry. ”Nothing easy about coal mining for a living but we all got by,” he said. ”There was more love in our family than the money.” He said his grandparents raised him. His mother and uncles played guitars and banjos but none of them played professionally, he said. He got his start on a radio station in Beckley, according to a biography on the Hall of Fame website. He had a $12 guitar that he carried in a pillowcase and he got to sing a song or two each week. Eventually he’d go out and sing with the stars of the station, he said. He was still in high school at the time. He moved on to a station in Cincinnati, where he was doing a morning show when country star Roy Acuff came for a visit in the 1940s. Acuff invited Dickens to sing a song in his show, which the star liked enough to help get Dickens an invitation to sing at the Opry even before he had a record. ”I went down there and did that and it worked for me,” Dickens said.  He said he wanted to be remembered for his honesty with his fans and coworkers and for his desire to always get better as a performer. People we lost: 2014"
"Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump harshly responded to civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis on Saturday, calling him ”all talk” and ”no action” after Lewis said Trump was not a ”legitimate” president. ”Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk   no action or results. Sad,” Trump tweeted Saturday, which happened to fall on the weekend of the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday. Trump later doubled down on his criticism    though he did not take aim at Lewis’ district    tweeting Saturday night: ”Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested   of the U. S. I can use all the help I can get!” Lewis    an ally of King who was brutally beaten by police in Selma, Alabama, in 1965 while marching for civil rights    represents a Georgia district that includes most of Atlanta. On the campaign trail, Trump regularly decried crime in urban areas while pledging to revitalize neighborhoods primarily populated by black Americans. A Hillary Clinton supporter, Lewis criticized Trump’s ascension to head of state due to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election. ”I don’t see this   as a legitimate president,” the   Democrat told NBC News’ Chuck Todd in a clip released Friday.  It was an astonishing rebuke by a sitting member of Congress toward an incoming President. Trump, however, largely launched his political career by calling into question the legitimacy of President Barack Obama’s presidency by repeatedly suggesting he wasn’t born in the United States. John Lewis: Trump is not a ’legitimate’ president, Cornell William Brooks, the president of the NAACP, said Trump’s remarks were disrespectful and called on him to apologize. ”By disrespecting @repjohnlewis, @realDonaldTrump dishonored Lewis’ sacrifice  demeaned Americans  the rights, he nearly died 4. Apologize,” Brooks tweeted, including an image of a bloodied Lewis taken during the Civil Rights Era. Donna Brazile, the interim head of the Democratic National Committee, denounced Trump’s remarks and said at a DNC gathering in Phoenix that Lewis ”took action.” ”He took action from marching from Selma to Montgomery. He took action in marching toward men wielding clubs across the Pettus Bridge. They fractured his skull because of the color of his skin. But John Lewis never stopped marching for justice and equality for all people,” she said. Meanwhile, Democratic members of Congress, highlighting Lewis’ contributions to the civil rights movement, swiftly condemned Trump. ”Ahead of #MLKday2017, let us remember that many have tried to silence @repjohnlewis over the years. All have failed,” tweeted House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. California Sen. Kamala Harris said Lewis doesn’t deserve to be attacked by Trump. ”John Lewis is an icon of the Civil Rights Movement who is fearless in the pursuit of justice and equality. He deserves better than this,” she tweeted. Rep. Keith Ellison, who is vying to become the Democratic National Committee chairman, said Trump has ”no clue” who Lewis is.  ”. @repjohnlewis knows true sacrifice. @realDonaldTrump has no clue. When cluelessness collides with power oppression results. Resistance,” the Minnesota lawmaker said. And Republican Sen. Ben Sasse, a frequent Trump critic, praised Lewis, ”John Lewis and his ’talk’ have changed the world.” Republican Congressman Justin Amash also chimed in with advice for the   writing on Twitter: ”Dude, just stop.” By Saturday evening, Lewis was fundraising off Trump’s comments. ”Today, Donald Trump attacked me on Twitter. He said that I’m ’all talk’ and ’no action,’ ” Lewis wrote. ”I’ve been beaten bloody,   fighting for what’s right for America. I’ve marched at Selma with Dr. King. Sometimes that’s what it takes to move our country in the right direction.” He continued: ”Some leaders reject decades of progress and want to return to the dark past, when the power of law was used to deny the freedoms protected by the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and its Amendments.  ”I remember when segregation was the law of the land that ordered our society in the Deep South. The forces of law and order in Alabama were so strong that to take a stand against this injustice, we had to be willing to sacrifice our lives for our cause. ”It took massive,     dissent and criticism of this great nation and its laws to move toward a greater sense of equality in America.” Democrats skipping inauguration, Lewis is one of an increasing number of Democratic lawmakers who are boycotting Trump’s inauguration after learning more about Russia’s role in the 2016 election. Intelligence agencies have said Russia hacked Democratic groups with the intent of hurting Clinton’s campaign and aiding Trump’s. The   has repeatedly expressed skepticism at the conclusions. ”You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong,” Lewis told NBC News. California Rep. Barbara Lee said earlier this week she will spend the day organizing. ”Donald Trump has proven that his administration will normalize the most extreme fringes of the Republican Party. On Inauguration Day, I will not be celebrating. I will be organizing and preparing for resistance,” she said Thursday in a statement. Reps. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, Jared Huffman of California and Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, are also boycotting the historic event. ”I cannot go to (the) inauguration of a man who’s going to appoint people to the Supreme Court and turn back the clock on women and turn back the clock on immigrants and the safety and freedom that we fought for them,” Gutierrez said last month on CNN’s ”New Day.”"
"Washington (CNN) Republicans seeking the White House struggled to find their footing Friday after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of gay marriage, splitting between pushing to fight the issue directly or looking for ”religious freedom” protections. Candidates running closer to the center, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Lindsey Graham, issued   language urging their colleagues to focus on protecting ”religious freedom”. And Ohio Gov. John Kasich urged Republicans to respect the ruling and ditch the matter altogether.  Jeb Bush, ”In a country as diverse as ours, good people who have opposing views should be able to live side by side. It is now crucial that as a country we protect religious freedom and the right of conscience and also not discriminate,” Bush said in his statement. The Bush campaign later told CNN he would oppose efforts to amend the Constitution to ban gay marriage. But conservative firebrands in the   pack, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, said that conservatives must stand and fight, by seeking a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Mike Huckabee and Bobby Jindal  ”I will not acquiesce to an imperial court any more than our founders acquiesced to an imperial British monarch. We must resist and reject judicial tyranny, not retreat,” Huckabee said in a statement.  Jindal tweeted that no ”earthly court” could alter the definition of marriage. The issue has quickly evolved from a wedge issue that used to divide Democrats, even as recently as the 2008 election cycle, to a sticky issue for Republicans looking to bridge the divide between social conservatives and older voters who make up much of their base, and younger conservatives who vary between not caring much on the issue to believing it should be a right. A May   poll showed that 59% of Republican and   independents under the age of 50 supported a constitutional right for gays and lesbians to marry, while 61% did not. That divide, and a string of earlier rulings upholding gay marriage, already had conservatives battling in Statehouses across the nation for ”religious freedom” measures they said would protect Christian bakers and others from having to cater   weddings. RELATED: Activists prepare for gay marriage decision, Hillary Clinton, For Democratic candidates, who have had little trouble embracing the issue this time around, their elation at the high court’s ruling was swift.  Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who’s own views ”evolved” like many others, tweeted that she was ”Proud to celebrate a historic victory for marriage equality —   the courage  determination of LGBT Americans who made it possible.  ” Martin O’Malley, And former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who successfully pushed for legalization in 2012, tweeted photo of the Maryland family at the center of that battle. ”Reminded of Will and his moms on the day we passed marriage equality in MD. There’s no greater human right than love,” O’Malley tweeted."
"ESPN fired Curt Schilling for saying men are men and women are women and they ought to use the bathroom that corresponds to their sex. [However, ESPN was far more forgiving of one of its anchors eight years ago who insulted Christianity using a profanity that can’t even be used on the sports network.  On January 11, 2008, ESPN anchor Dana Jacobson launched an   tirade at an Atlantic City ESPN roast, including the phrase “f**k Jesus. ” According to a Christian Post article, “She was reportedly intoxicated during the incident, talking vulgarly about Jesus and a colleague’s alma mater, Notre Dame. ” An Atlantic City paper reported at the time that Jacobson was “swilling vodka from a Belvedere bottle, mumbling along and cursing like a sailor. ” ESPN said at the time, “Her actions and comments were inappropriate and we’ve dealt with it. ” ESPN “dealt with” the   slur by suspending the employee for a week. Former major league pitching ace Curt Schilling says that men in dresses ought not to pee in the women’s room. That caused a firestorm of criticism from the sexual left. It demanded his firing, and ESPN complied. Reverend Pat Mahoney, who led a protest against ESPN over Jacobson, pointed out that “eight years ago ESPN sports announcer, Dana Jacobson, said ‘F**k Jesus’ at an ESPN event. We called for her to be fired for her bigoted and hateful comments. Her punishment was a week’s suspension. Fast forward to Curt Shilling being fired for making remarks about the transgender community on social media. My question to ESPN is, don’t you think saying ‘F**k Jesus’ is as offensive as what Shilling did?”"
"’’ ”I’m often asked by people what car they should buy. The answer isn’t necessarily all that easy, because everybody has different needs.” ”I’m rarely asked what sports car to buy, though. Most people who want one of those babies have been thinking about something specific for years if not decades. They might have had a Porsche or Ferrari poster on the bedroom wall, and that sealed the deal when they were teenagers.” ”However, in the event that I do encounter somebody who wants   buying advice, I know have a simple, straightforward answer: Get a 2017 Mustang GT convertible with a   manual and a big old   V8. It will set you back less than $50, 000, for a reasonably   example like the test car I recently enjoyed. For three seasons in much of the USA and four in the warmer climates, you will have so much fun with this car that you’ll be dippy.” ”Mind you, I am by nature a     type of guy. The new Mazda   Miata is my cup of tea and the only proper sports car I’ve ever owned (a   model). Moving up the power band, I rather like the Porsche 911 and have no issues with Corvettes.” ’’ ”The   ’Stang wth that 5.  V8 and an excellent   is just all sweet spot. There’s also a V6 available, a 3.  making 300 horsepower, which would also be okay, if far less stonking, and a 2.  turbocharged   shaves the output down to 285 hp  —   both come with the   stick standard.” ”The Mustang was completely revamped for its 50th anniversary in 2015. The result was a departure from ’Stangs of the past in that the new Pony Car was definitely less       and more    . The suspension was upgraded from the reliable old   design, which was great for drag racing but not really up to the task of keeping the car settled through tight maneuvers. ” ’That   vibe has been supplanted by something that has more of a whiff of the European about it, but the core values of the Mustang we all know and love have been deftly preserved. For example, when you put the GT in Sport mode and stomp on the pedal, the front end rises up and the rear end hunkers down. You can literally feel the rear tires gaining purchase in the pavement, digging in as the torque from the V8 is laid in through, for the sake of argument, second gear. Brembos all around keep matters in check. ’ ’The symphony of combustion piping out of the motor (nicknamed ”Coyote”) is fairly glorious. Not quite as robust and stirring as what owners of the   Shelby 350 can access via their larger 5.  Voodoo V8. But really, just fine. It’’s a decently delivered burble and bark, nothing that will scare the neighbors, but enough to hold your attention when merging to the legal speed limit. Fuel economy is what you should expect, which is not that great: 14     combined.’ ’’ ’With a   mph time of 4. 3 seconds, you will not want for acceleration. But neither will you have your ears pinned back and your neck whiplashed. The velocity is manageable. ’ ”Even better, the convertible GT isn’t a ride that you need to take  ’ to have a good time. I drove four adults around (yes, the back seats can handle two of those) my New Jersey town on a warm night in early summer and we kept it around 25 mph the whole time. Essentially, we cruised.

"Brunswick, Georgia (CNN) Attorneys Monday painted two portraits of Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia man who’s accused of deliberately leaving his infant son to die in a hot car in a suburban Atlanta parking lot. The portraits were not completely dissimilar. In closing arguments, prosecutors argued that Harris left his son,    Cooper, inside his SUV for seven hours in June 2014 because he was driven by his selfish need to pursue ”escapes,” which included extramarital affairs and sending texts to as many as six women that very day, including one underage girl. But defense attorneys didn’t dispute Harris’s philandering, even admitting that the suburban Atlanta father was ”hooking up when he wanted.” They countered that Harris, 35, didn’t need to abandon his life as a father because he was already pursuing relationships outside of his marriage, and they argued Cooper’s death was a ”tragic accident brought about by a lapse in memory.” Harris’ fate is now in the hands of jurors, who will begin deliberations Tuesday morning after hearing five weeks of testimony. Although the boy’s death occurred in Cobb County, publicity around the case captivated the Atlanta area and led Judge Mary Staley to move the proceedings 300 miles away to Brunswick, on the Georgia coast.  Charges against Harris, a web developer for The Home Depot who lived in Marietta, include malice murder, two counts of felony murder and cruelty to children in the first degree. He faces up to life in prison if convicted. Some of the charges in Harris’ indictment stemmed not from his son’s death, but from Harris’ alleged habit of sending sexual text messages to underage girls. Prosecutors made prominent mention throughout the trial that Harris was having illicit chats with several women on the day Cooper died. His wife Leanna, who testified at the trial, has since filed for divorce.  ’Death and deception’ On Monday, Cobb County prosecutor Chuck Boring put Harris’ liaisons front and center in his closing argument, using the defendant’s own words. ”’I love my son and all, but we both need escapes.’ Those words were uttered 10 minutes before this defendant, with a selfish abandon and malignant heart, did exactly that,” Boring told jurors. On June 18, 2014, the sweltering day of his son’s death, Harris had arrived at his job in suburban Atlanta at around 9:30 in the morning, and left Cooper strapped into his car seat while he went inside to his office for work.  Later that morning, Harris and some   left the office for lunch. Upon returning at about 12:45 that afternoon, Harris went to his car and opened the door to put away some light bulbs he had bought during the lunch break. The defense says Harris did not notice his son, still in the backseat. According to medical examiners, Cooper was likely already dead. ”This is a case about death, deception and a double life,” Boring, the prosecutor, said to the jury. ”The torturous murder of Cooper Harris, the deception all over his life and in this case with the police, his wife and everyone involved, and the double life that reveals his motive and the malice in this case.” Of key interest to the prosecution was the position of Cooper’s car seat in Harris’s SUV. Boring argued that Harris could see his son sitting in his car seat when he stowed the light bulbs.  ”If this child was visible in that car, that is not a failure in memory systems,” Boring argued.  ”Cooper would have been visible to anyone inside that car. Flat out.”  He added, ”If Cooper was visible, the defendant is guilty of all counts.”  ’He enjoyed being a dad’ But defense attorney Maddox Kilgore argued that Harris’ sexual behavior had nothing to do with Cooper’s death. Kilgore maintained that Cobb County Police investigators only focused on details that fit the state’s theory of the case. ”The state wants to bury him in this filth and dirt of his own making so that you will believe he is so immoral, he is so reprehensible that he can do exactly this,” Kilgore said.  But he argued, ”Ross was already doing what he wanted to do.” He added, ”As far as Ross was concerned, he had a good thing going. He complained about sex in his marriage a lot, but he enjoyed the family aspect of it. He enjoyed being a dad.” Instead, Kilgore asked jurors if the law enforcement investigation was really a search for the truth. ”You have been misled from start to finish with the entirety of this testimony,” he argued."

"Hillary Clinton’s determination to keep control of the   Clinton Foundation shows that she’s willing to sell favors if she’s elected to the Oval Office, says a spokesman for Donald Trump. [“Given the repeated examples of Clinton Foundation donors and officials receiving access and favors from Hillary Clinton’s State Department, what she is proposing is to essentially plant a giant ‘for sale’ sign on the White House lawn,” said the statement from campaign spokesman Jason Miller.  Miller’s comments came after Clinton insisted on Monday that Bill Clinton should help run the foundation if she is elected president. “I don’t think there are conflicts of interest,” the Democratic presidential nominee told ABC News. “I know that that’s what has been alleged and never proven,” she added. Trump’s campaign quickly slammed Clinton’s plan to keep family control over the foundation, which would allow foreign governments and private lobbies to put money into her back pocket by donating to the New   foundation. “The fact Hillary Clinton believes it is appropriate for her husband to remain on the board of the Clinton Foundation if she is elected is proof that she operates in a permanent ethical blind spot and lacks the judgment to be president,” said Miller. This would present an unacceptable and unprecedented conflict of interest which would compromise her presidency beyond repair. That’s why the country’s leading newspapers, ethicists, and even top Democrats are calling on the Clintons to separate from the Clinton Foundation or to even shut it down. Clinton’s continued desire to keep family control over the foundation, however, is facing increased rhetorical opposition from liberal and progressive media outlets, which have grown alarmed over the political hazards created by evidence of   corruption and   at the foundation. On Aug. 30, The New York Times editorial board said the family should “End Their Operational Involvement In The Foundation And Its Affiliates For The Duration Of Her Presidency. ” A wiser course would be to ban contributions from foreign and corporate entities now. If Mrs. Clinton wins, Bill and Chelsea Clinton should both end their operational involvement in the foundation and its affiliates for the duration of her presidency, relinquishing any control over spending, hiring and board appointments. The Boston Globe declared Aug. 16 that the foundation should be shuttered. Although the charity founded by former President Bill Clinton has done admirable work over the last 15 years, the Clinton Foundation is also clearly a liability for Hillary Clinton as she seeks the presidency. The     first family will have plenty to keep them busy next year if Hillary Clinton defeats Donald Trump in November. The foundation should remove a political  —   and actual  —   distraction and stop accepting funding. If Clinton is elected, the foundation should be shut down. On Aug. 23, The Washington Post‘s  editorial board called for the family to quit the foundation. Should Ms. Clinton win, all of that work and all of the foundation’s assets should be spun off to an organization with no ties to the first family. Even establishment Republicans are speaking up. “She was playing both sides   …    It’s absolutely deplorable,” Sen. John Cornyn told The Hill on Friday. “As she was performing her job of secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation was shaking down donors who were buying access. ” But Clinton is defending the foundation, and she told ABC: I feel very good about the work of the foundation. I feel very good about my service as secretary of state. No decision I ever made was influenced by anybody. What I made a decision based on was what was good for the United States, what was good for our values, our interests, and our security. And the State Department has confirmed there’s no evidence of any such influence at all. All of these questions about the Clinton Foundation, I am more than happy to answer. But I do hope that people will take a look at what the foundation has done, what charitable enterprises it’s involved in.   …     No decision I made was, you know, influenced by anything other than doing what was best for the United States.

" (CNN)  filmmaker Bruce Sinofsky, whose series on the ”West Memphis Three” cast doubt on the murder convictions of three Arkansas teenagers, catalyzing a movement that led to their release, died Saturday, longtime collaborator Joe Berlinger said. The   winning documentary director died in his sleep of complications from diabetes, Berlinger said. He was 58.  ”Bruce’s humanity is on every frame of the films that he leaves behind, and words can’t express how graced I feel my life has been by having the extraordinary opportunity of being able to say we were partners and, more importantly, best friends,” said Berlinger. The duo collaborated on Sinofsky’s debut, the critically acclaimed ”Brother’s Keeper,” before turning to the ”Paradise Lost” trilogy, a series of films that drew attention to the case of three teen boys convicted in 1994 of killing three Cub Scouts in West Memphis, Arkansas. The films, released in 1996, 2004 and 2011, raised questions about the evidence, drawing attention from musicians including Eddie Vedder, Tom Waits and Henry Rollins, who pushed for a review of the case. After spending 18 years in prison, Jessie Misskelley, Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin were released pursuant to a complicated plea agreement in September 2011, one month before the final installment, ”Purgatory,” was released. The film was nominated for an Academy Award. As the case wended though the courts, Sinokfsky and Berlinger turned their attention to metal band Metallica, whose music was featured in the first two installments of ”Paradise Lost.” The result was 2004’s ”Metallica: Some Kind of Monster.”  Sinofsky also directed PBS’ ”Good Rockin’ Tonight: The Legacy of Sun Records,” an installment of The History Channel’s ”10 Days that Unexpectedly Changed America” and episodes of the Sundance Channel’s ”Iconoclasts” series. He won multiple Emmys, a Peabody and an Independent Spirit Award for his work.   Berlinger recalled Sinofsky’s dedication to his first film ”Brother’s Keeper,” despite a lack of of financial backing or equipment. ”Bruce encouraged both of us to throw caution into the wind to start capturing what would become ’Brother’s Keeper’ in 1991 with no money in our pockets, in the   16mm age of   when making a   film took a little more ingenuity to get in the can,” he said in a statement.  ”His unique combination of courage and empathy made that possible, as well as everything that came after for us. The extraordinary adventures we had on the road and the deeply stimulating experiences we had in the editing room were   for all of us who knew him thanks to his wisdom and fervor to change the world. ” A memorial service will be held in March.

" (CNN) The number of births in the United States went up last year for the first time since 2007, according to an annual report by the CDC National Center for Health Statistics. The report found that there were 62. 9 births for every 1, 000 women between the ages of 15 and 44, which represents an increase of 1% over the birth rate in 2013. The spike was driven by women in their 30s and early 40s, who had 3% and 2% more births, respectively, than in the previous year. For women in their 30s, the birth rates were 100. 8 per 1, 000 women age 30 to 34 and 50. 9 per 1, 000 women age 35 to 39. In contrast, the birth rate among teens 15 to 19, which has been waning since 1991, plummeted 9% since 2013. It was 24. 2 per 1, 000 teens in 2014. The rate among women in their early 20s also dropped by 2%. ”The births to older women was enough to offset the decline in teen birth rate and you see this overall increase,” said Brady E. Hamilton, a statistician and demographer at the National Center for Health Statistics and lead author of the study.  ”In regards to the older women, this is kind of a continuation of a trend, but the decline in teens 15 to 19 really shocked me 9% is really phenomenal,” Hamilton said.   The birth rate among teens has gone down 61% since 1991. But the rate of decline has picked up speed in the last seven years, dropping 7% annually between 2007 and 2013 and now 9% in the last year. The economic downturn that started in 2007 is probably partly responsible for the reproductive downturn among all age groups, including teens, Hamilton said. Now that the economy has improved, older women may be having the births that they postponed several years earlier, he added. But the rate of teen births has not rebounded. This success story could be due to the number of programs and policies, such as those led by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, Hamilton said. ”There seems to be a cultural shift among teens and young adults valuing not getting pregnant,” said Laura Lindberg, a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute. Teens and young adults are increasingly able to prevent undesired pregnancies because of improved access to contraceptives and other services, Lindberg added. The decline has occurred in every racial and socioeconomic group and state, suggesting that the decline is due to a widespread increase in access to services and contraceptives, Lindberg said. ”We are likely to see continued decline [among teens and young adults] driven in part by the increased use of IUDs (intrauterine devices),” Lindberg said.  The CDC abortion surveillance indicates that there has not been in increase in abortions among teens, at least since 2011 (the last year that data were available). The trend of fewer teen births is probably not because more teens are having abortions, said Theodore J. Joyce, professor of economics at Baruch College at the City University of New York.   The birth rate for women 30 to 34 and 35 to 39 has been increasing steadily since 2011 and 2010, according to the CDC report. ”We are seeing this as sign of the times that people are responding to the end of the recession by being more comfortable in having a child,” Lindberg said. However it is not clear if the trend will continue, she added. The number of births among older women 40 to 44 has been increasing steadily since at least 1990, including over the period from 2007 to 2013. Women in their 40s may not feel like they have the option to postpone pregnancy as much as younger women, said Hamilton, author of the current report. The overall birth rate increase in 2014 was observed among all races, except for American Indian and Alaska Native women. Hamilton and his colleagues are following up with an   report on birth rates, which will include more information about these two groups as well as different Hispanic groups, such as Mexican and Puerto Rican. The report also looked at several details of maternal and infant health. It found that the rate of preterm births continued to decrease, to 9. 57% in 2014 the rate of low birthweight (newborns weighing less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces) has been on the decline since 2007 and was 8% in 2014. The rate of cesarean delivery also dropped 2% from 32. 7% in 2013 to 32. 2% in 2014. ”This is the biggest drop in 20 years,” said Dr. Aaron B. Caughey, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health  Science University. ”Ob gyns have become more conservative about doing cesarean deliveries in the last four or five years because there is a more clear recognition of the risk for the mother both for the current and future pregnancies,” said Caughey, who   the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations on cesarean delivery."
"The New York Post reports that Hillary Clinton’s team avoided taking her to the emergency room following her medical scare on Sunday in order to “keep the details of her medical treatment under wraps. ” [Hillary Clinton was headed to an emergency room following her sudden collapse during the Sept. 11 memorial ceremony  —   but ditched her NYPD escort and detoured to daughter Chelsea Clinton’s apartment to keep details of her medical treatment under wraps, The Post has learned.  Secret Service protocol called for the Democratic presidential nominee to be taken to a   Level I Trauma Center in the wake of her Sunday morning health crisis at Ground Zero, sources said. But a campaign operative decided to change course to avoid treatment by doctors, nurses or other medical workers who could leak details to reporters, a source said. Clinton’s van was supposed to be escorted by an NYPD protective detail, but the Secret Service whisked her away from Ground Zero before cops could accompany her, another source said. Clinton had told police officials that she didn’t want the escort at all, but the NYPD overruled that request, the source added. Read the rest here."
"CHILDREN are usually forced to pick just one or two of their beloved stuffed animals to take with them on summer vacation. Adults should consider doing the same with their electronic devices. You don’t want to weigh down your travel bag with gear you will barely use. And you probably should leave your more expensive gadgets at home, unless you want to become a target for muggers. What to do? My personal packing starts with devices that are compact and lightweight. The price tag should not exceed $500, and if my smartphone can capably perform a task, I don’t bother with something that does the same thing. Here is a guide to products that I have found useful on an airplane, in a rental car, in a hotel, in an Airbnb house rental and outdoors, or traveling overseas. I have tested all of the items in the last few years, and some of them were purchased through The Wirecutter, a product recommendations website and creative partner of The New York Times. This happens too often: After cramming into your airplane seat, you shut your eyes to relax and a baby starts screaming behind you. You need a media device to drown out the noise with music or a movie. My favorite media tablet for travel is the Apple iPad Mini, which starts at $399 (though I would buy the $499 model for the extra storage). Its compact size makes it easier to rest on an airplane tray. Because it is a multifunctional tablet, you can choose from a host of distractions, such as reading a book and playing a mobile game. (In other words, leave your Kindle at home.) For watching videos on a tablet, SeaGate’s wireless portable hard drive, which costs $100, may also be worth stowing in your   luggage. Ahead of your trip, you can load movies and other media onto the hard drive, and the drive creates its own   network to stream movies to your iPad. As for earphones, I will skip recommending a fancy pair of earbuds  —   just another small, valuable item to lose on a trip. The earbuds that came with your smartphone, like the Apple EarPods, should sufficiently drown out the noise. Most hotels include cable television, but after channel surfing for a few hours, you will realize that the only movies that ever seem to air are “Total Recall” and “The Shawshank Redemption. ” Chances are you will be aching for the variety of programs you could get from streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and HBO. So I would pack Roku’s new Streaming Stick, which is the size of a thumb drive, making it easy to stow in a travel pouch. One major bonus of the Roku stick is a feature called Hotel  Dorm Connect. It bypasses an obstacle in many hotels  —   the requirement that you log into their   networks through a web page  —   by letting you enter the credentials through your smartphone browser. Another common headache in a hotel is finding enough outlets to charge multiple gadgets. Anker’s   USB wall charger can be plugged into a single outlet to charge four USB devices at the same time. The most annoying part of renting a car is all the upsells, particularly the extra fee for a GPS device and a mount  —   as if your smartphone did not provide maps already. The best solution is to pack your own smartphone car mount. TechMatte’s MagGrip CD Slot, which costs only $11, is a fantastic travel companion on trips with lots of driving. The mount holds your phone with a magnet you put a magnet sticker on your smartphone case, so mounting your phone is as simple as tapping the back of the phone on top of the magnet. What’s more, because the MagGrip hooks up to an unused CD player slot, the phone doesn’t block your view of the road. As for playing music from your phone, I recommend packing a standard audio jack that connects a smartphone with a stereo system, like the $5 audio cable from Amazon. When renting a house on Airbnb or a similar site like HomeAway, the situation may be different from a hotel if a large group and a kitchen are involved. This may sound odd, but I have found it extremely useful to pack a sous vide precision cooker on Airbnb trips. First, a primer: A sous vide cooker heats water to a precise temperature you seal food like steaks and salmon into plastic bags and immerse them in the water to cook them evenly at that temperature. The $199 Anova Precision Cooker, recommended by our technology columnist Farhad Manjoo, is slim enough to store in a weekender bag. Anova’s cooker also includes a bracket so that the device can be easily mounted to your Airbnb host’s cooking pot  —   meaning all you probably need to pack are the cooker and some   bags. The benefit of bringing along a sous vide cooker is the amount of time it frees up for you to enjoy other activities instead of paying attention to your food. Imagine going hiking for three hours and returning to a perfectly cooked   beef roast. It beats going to a restaurant. When you’re outside, you don’t need much technology other than a camera. Assuming you bought a smartphone in the last few years, don’t bother packing an extra camera like a GoPro  —   that’s just extra space and another power cable to carry around. Instead, if you’re going to be in the water kayaking or splashing around at the beach, consider a waterproof smartphone case like LifeProof’s Fre, which fits snugly around an iPhone to protect it from water without making it look ugly. If you are the type who enjoys drowning out the sounds of nature with music, the $100 Roll from Ultimate Ears, which I recommended last holiday season, continues to be my favorite wireless portable speaker. It has a slim disk shape, making it easy to pack in a travel pouch, and includes a bungee cord for strapping it onto a lawn chair or bench. Plus, it’s waterproof. Earlier this year, I wrote a guide on taking your smartphone abroad while traveling, which involved unlocking it and buying foreign SIM cards. Some readers encouraged me to also mention Google’s Project Fi, which is offered in more than 120 countries and charges the same rate no matter where you are: $20 a month for unlimited minutes and text messages and $10 per gigabyte of data. In my testing of Google Fi for a few weeks, I found that the service offered robust coverage comparable to that of traditional wireless carriers. However, there are caveats: Google Fi is available only on a small number of Android phones, and in foreign countries, the data speeds are capped. I recommend a Google Fi phone, with prices starting at $199 on Google’s webpage, for people who frequently travel abroad. But for those who seldom go overseas, it is more practical to use a foreign SIM card with your own phone. Also when traveling abroad, your smartphone battery is going to be struggling because of all the pictures you take. For iPhones, I recommend Apple’s $99 Smart Battery Case  —   it offers enough power to keep your phone running all day. You can also charge it with the Lightning cable included with iPhones, so you will have one fewer power cable to pack. For Androids, the AmazonBasics Portable Power Bank is an excellent battery pack."
"Wednesday on his radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh questioned CNN’s David Gergen for his assertion that Breitbart editor at large Peter Schweizer’s book “Clinton Cash” had been discredited following a speech in which presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had widely cited the book.  Limbaugh pointed out that other major media outlets had used it in their reporting and that it was possible Gergen was making the assumption that it had been discredited without actually having any evidence to back it up. Partial transcript as follows: Look, I know this has been a speedy search.  I can’t find anywhere where the Peter Schweizer book “Clinton Cash” has been “discredited” like David “Rodham” Gergen said, and he just said it like everybody knows it’s been discredited.  Now, I think people in the Clinton camp like David “Rodham” Gergen  —   and I really believe this. I think they are so in love, I think they are so hitched to the Clintons  —   I think they’re so attached I think they are so, so, so devoted  —   that they don’t even know.  And because they’re so devoted and because they think so highly of themselves, they don’t think it’s possible.  “All this stuff in the Schweizer book, Clinton Cash, that’s gotta be,” the way they look at that, “discredited. That’s gotta be typical   BS!  That’s gotta be more Gary Aldrich and the FBI agent and the book he writes. That’s gotta be more of what the American Spectator puts out. ” They just “discredited” it in their own minds.  “The Clintons aren’t that way. We know the Clintons,” and they’re so invested in the Clintons succeeding that they just reject it.  You know, it’s like Clinton, at some point  …     Here, this is a great question to ask.  We continue to get this. Like the latest is Dolly Kyle.  We continue to get women popping up all over this country describing affairs they’ve had with Bill Clinton.  Could somebody explain to me, why does Bill Clinton get the benefit of the doubt on that? If there is anybody officially established as a horndog who has been president of the United States  —   if there ever is a man who has had numerous affairs in the Oval Office, outside the Oval Office, in the governor’s office in Arkansas, around the world, palling around with noted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein  —   why does Bill Clinton get the benefit of the doubt?  After all of these years, there ought to be a reaction. Common sense would say, “You know what?  This many allegations, there has to be something there. ”  But they continue. The Clinton side continues to suggest that all of this has been discredited, all these allegations of Clinton   around are just partisan political operatives making things up.  Why in the world does this guy still get the benefit of the doubt on this stuff?  There is nobody under the sun in the world of common sense that the benefit of the doubt would ever be so extended. This guy can been accused of rape, and that doesn’t seem to bother them.  Now they come out and say  —   David Gergen today  —   that the Schweizer book’s been “discredited. ” It hasn’t.  In fact, you ought to know the Washington Post and New York Times have even quoted it.  The Washington Post and the New York Times have all made exclusive arrangements with Peter Schweizer to pursue the claims made in the book, and they did, and they never found any evidence that he was wrong.  Not only has Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash not been discredited, the New York Times and the Washington Post both ran excerpts from it. So the question is, did David “Rodham” Gergen know what he’s talking about, or does he know something we don’t know?  Because that book has not “been discredited. ”  Let me give you a couple of other really laughable examples of how the   are dealing with Trump’s speech today.  And I know some of you haven’t heard it yet, but just sit tight.  Because we do the news as it breaks.  The New York Times, in a   story after Trump’s speech, quote Trump as saying something that’s not true. Quote, “Hillary has spent her entire life making money for special interests, and I will tell you she’s made plenty of money for them, and she has been taking plenty of money out for herself. ”  He’s basically accused her of getting rich by being in Washington, by getting rich supposedly helping all these charities.  And you want to hear the New York Times’ objection to that?  You want to hear the New York Times “ ” response to that?  “Well, that’s not entirely true.  Hillary Clinton worked for the Children’s Defense Fund, and she was on the Watergate committee. ” I kid you not. So Trump says that Hillary has been so corrupt that all these charities that she’s been involved in, she’s taken a lot of money out, and they cite two things where Trump’s wrong: The Children’s Defense Fund (which was run by her buddy, Marian Wright Edelman) and the fact that she served on the Watergate committee.  Those are the only two things the New York Times, as of now, could come up with to show that Trump’s not accurate in what he said.  Well, I’m sorry, but that’s nothing. The point is, they can’t refute the charge.  And I think that’s really the key here with the David “Rodham” Gergen sound bite. He has to say that it was one of Trump’s best speeches, it was one of his most effective speeches, it was disciplined.  But then he has to go out and talk about all the exaggerations and all the slander. “You just can’t slander people! This book has basically been discredited. ” I think that the   knit Hillary circle, they know this is the kind of stuff she may not be able to deal with as easily as her husband was able to deal with it. She’s not got the likability quotient.  She just doesn’t have a connection with people that make them naturally want to defend her. She does not have a connection with people that makes them want to disbelieve this kind of stuff, like her husband does.  And I think they know it, and I think they’re actually a little worried here.  They know that this speech, depending on what happens with it now, has the potential of doing really, really great damage. And so they have to go out and create this illusion that this book  —   Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer  —   has been discredited, when it hasn’t been.  But so far  —   and I’m sure we’re gonna get it, but I haven’t seen it yet.  I haven’t seen any   in the Post or the New York Times reject Trump’s claims that she’s a world class liar, that she’s corrupt.  I haven’t seen any.  I’m sure that’s coming.  I’m sure Clinton defenders are assiduously and energetically working on replies to all this even as we speak. But the point is that in the moments afterwards there is not a readymade reply to anything Trump said that would nuke Trump.  They’re having to craft it.  They’re having to carefully assemble it and put it together. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo"
"HAZLETON, Pa.  —   Thousands of Dominicans have poured into this little city in eastern Pennsylvania since 2001 to work in the food plants and warehouses on the edge of town, where the highway to New York meets the highway to Philadelphia. Hazleton’s population is growing for the first time in more than half a century. Landlords, doctors and shopkeepers are learning to love their new customers. But the city’s economic evolution has left behind its previous,   working class, and the presidential election has crystallized its frustrations. Many of those losing ground economically, including lifelong Democrats, say they plan to vote for Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee. Many of those who are prospering, including lifelong Republicans, say they will vote for the Democrat, Hillary Clinton. For both sides, how to deal with immigration has become a defining political issue, one that is likely to transcend the contretemps over Mr. Trump’s treatment of women that has cost him so much support among elected Republicans. This city was built by European immigrants who flocked here a century ago to work in the coal mines. Their children found better jobs in the factories. Now their grandchildren are struggling against economic decline and cultural displacement. “I don’t care for this town no more because of the Hispanics,” said Lewis Beishline, 70, as he sat drinking at 11 a. m. on a Friday at Cusat’s Cafe, a bar owned by the mayor of Hazleton, who lives upstairs. Mr. Beishline, a retired welder, said he moved from Hazleton to a nearby town last year because he no longer felt safe. He plans to vote for Mr. Trump, he said, “because of the immigration. ” The Hispanic community, meanwhile, is eager to establish its own political power in the face of what many describe as persistent and painful discrimination. Community leaders in this city of 25, 000 say they have registered more than 800 Hispanic voters in recent months, expanding the voting rolls by almost 10 percent. “I tell my kids, if someone asks where you are from, you say ‘Hazleton,’” said Guillermo Lara, 49, who moved here from Mexico in the early 1990s and whose two daughters were born here. “We’re here, and we don’t go nowhere. We want more. ” That sharp divide is mirrored by the candidates seeking the Oval Office. Beyond his promised wall and deportations, Mr. Trump has denigrated immigrants repeatedly, at times without distinguishing between legal and illegal immigration. “Donald Trump’s position on illegal immigration plays a big role in his support not only in Hazleton but in northeast Pennsylvania,” said Lou Barletta, a Republican who represents the region in Congress and has stood by his nominee as other Republicans in Congress have fled. In 2006, as Hazleton’s mayor, Mr. Barletta championed a     ordinance penalizing employers and landlords for dealing with illegal immigrants. The courts blocked it from taking effect, but Mr. Barletta said Mr. Trump’s popularity reflected the continued demand for stronger government action. “He’s going to win here, and win big,” Mr. Barletta said. Mr. Barletta introduced Mr. Trump at a rally in nearby   on Monday night, declaring that voters in northeastern Pennsylvania would propel Mr. Trump to the White House. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, has celebrated immigrants, both legal and illegal, as important contributors to American society. Her campaign describes her plan to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants as one of her most important ideas for increasing economic growth. “Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together  —   and it’s the right thing to do,” Mrs. Clinton said in accepting the party’s presidential nomination in Philadelphia, about 100 miles southeast of Hazleton. The Hispanic population grew faster in Luzerne County, which includes Hazleton, than almost any other county between 2000 and 2011, according to the Pew Research Center. While immigration has slowed since the 2008 recession, Hispanics continue to move here from larger cities like New York and Paterson, N. J. In the 2000 census, just 4. 9 percent of Hazleton’s population identified as Hispanic. A decade later, that figure was 37 percent. By 2014, the most recent data available, 46 percent of the population said it was Hispanic. In all likelihood, Hazleton is now a   city, just like the nearby cities of Reading and Allentown. The Hispanic ascendence emerged from seismic economic shifts, said Jamie Longazel, a professor of sociology at the University of Dayton who grew up just outside Hazleton and wrote a book, “Undocumented Fears,” about the city’s struggles with immigration. When the local coal mines began to close in the 1950s, Hazleton residents raised money to build an industrial park that attracted factories to the region. When the factories began to leave in the 1990s, the city mobilized again. Local officials won state permission to create one of Pennsylvania’s largest   Keystone Opportunity Zones. A Cargill meat processing and distribution plant arrived in 2001. Other distribution businesses have followed, including an Amazon. com warehouse. Many residents claim that city officials advertised for   immigrant labor on billboards in New York or New Jersey, but Mr. Longazel said there was no evidence that ever happened. The truth is that the immigration was unanticipated but most likely inevitable. “The new jobs don’t pay as much as the old jobs did, and the reality is that   folks were just not interested,” Mr. Longazel said. The city also was also aging. Almost a quarter of the population was over 65 in 2000, roughly twice the national average. And nature abhors a vacuum  —   especially in a work force. Many of the new arrivals trace their roots to one Dominican city, San José de Ocoa. Hazleton’s old shopping streets, nearly abandoned in the 1990s, are now lined with Dominican bakeries, barbershops, travel agencies and Mexican restaurants. The Italian restaurants are now run by Mexican families. The city has two Spanish radio stations and a television station that broadcasts six hours of local programming a day. Stephen M. Schleicher, a dermatologist, said Hispanic residents now made up a third of his patients. He has hired a bilingual receptionist and is looking for a bilingual nurse. He has started placing ads in the local   newspaper. Dr. Schleicher, a lifelong Republican, said that Mr. Trump’s views on immigration had persuaded him, albeit reluctantly, to vote for Mrs. Clinton. “We’re seeing a total revitalization despite the government trying to keep the immigrants out,” he said. “It would have been a ghost town of older white people. ” Yet it is easy to overstate Hazleton’s recovery. Many of the new jobs pay poorly. Almost 29 percent of the population lived in poverty in 2014, almost twice the national average. And Hazleton’s evolution has inspired deep resentment. Many residents complain bitterly about the new arrivals not speaking English, about loud music late at night, about people walking in the street and driving without regard for traffic rules. Wana Bostic, 45, scrapes by on $11. 50 an hour as a home health aide. She said that she was not paid nearly enough, but that employers can squeeze workers because of the ready availability of immigrant labor. “No one talks about white Americans and what we really need,” she said. Crime has increased, as has drug use. The police force, meanwhile, has shrunk with declining tax revenue. Many residents are convinced that illegal immigration is to blame. “If you come into the country breaking the law, that’s not a good way to get your foot in the door,” said Nick Zapotocky, 31, who now has three deadbolt locks on the door of his home. “That says you’re willing to break the law again. ” He voted for President Obama in 2008. In 2012, he did not vote. And this year, he said he will vote for Mr. Trump. Francisco   said people were blinded by their fear of change, unable to see the benefits that immigration is bringing to Hazleton. Mr.   whose father was Mexican, runs a company that makes caps for old wells. He employs 30 people in the summer, only a few of them Hispanic. And he noted that some of the largest employers in the area are now Mexican companies, including Bimbo Bakeries, which has a plant nearby that makes millions of Thomas’ English Muffins. Mr.   said he had always voted Republican, loyal to his pocketbook. But he plans to vote for Mrs. Clinton, he said. “They fear they’re losing what they remember,” he said. “But what can you do? The United States is in evolution. Apple pie came after the Germans arrived. Maybe it will now be ‘As American as salsa.’ So what?” Hazleton still has no Hispanic elected officials. The city just added its first Hispanic police officer. The public school system, which has very few Hispanic teachers, was ordered by the federal Department of Education in 2014 to improve efforts to teach English to immigrants, and to communicate with parents. But a second generation of Hispanic Americans in Hazleton may force change. Mr. Lara worked three jobs to pay private school tuition so his daughters could avoid Hazleton’s high school. After   days in a factory, he washed dishes at night and cleaned offices on weekends. Two years ago, his eldest daughter, Amanda, graduated from Ithaca College in upstate New York with a degree in psychology and came home. She teaches   classes for Hispanic children in the building that was once her elementary school. It has become a community center thanks in large part to Joe Maddon, a Hazleton native who manages the Chicago Cubs. Ms. Lara, who is studying for a master’s degree at the University of Scranton, said racial tensions had increased. At the city’s annual Funfest, she noticed an empty space between the Hispanic vendors and the Polish and Italian vendors. “And I hear it from my kids,” she said of her students. “They’re not dumb. They can tell when they’re not liked or they’re not welcome. ” But she said she was not sure she wanted to move away. “People say, ‘Why would you want to stay there? ’” she said. “Well, for one thing, this is my hometown. ”"
"Washington (CNN) House Speaker John Boehner faces a looming threat from conservatives to oust him as speaker, and it’s tying his hands on funding the Department of Homeland Security. Congress passed a   extension of funding just hours before the deadline on Friday night. It was that fear fueling Boehner’s resistance to a   bill, as it might prompt backlash from conservatives. President Barack Obama signed the bill, which funds the Department of Homeland Security through Friday.  Two senior House Republican sources tell CNN there’s a serious concern among those close to the Speaker that if he allowed a vote on a clean DHS funding bill, conservatives would make a motion to vacate the chair, a direct challenge to his job. Conservatives have demanded that any funding bill include a provision rolling back President Barack Obama’s executive action delaying deportations for illegal immigrants. Democrats, meanwhile, remain staunchly opposed to tying the two together, and that fight has kept Congress in a stalemate over the bill all week, sending DHS right up to the funding deadline. While the Senate passed a clean bill funding DHS through the end of the fiscal year this week, it appears conservative opposition is currently discouraging Boehner from bringing up a similar bill in the House. Moderate Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Charlie Dent acknowledged he has also heard about conservatives using the fight over this DHS bill to try to remove Boehner. ”Right now, we have to get serious, I think a lot of people better get serious about governing and it’s time for all of these, you know D. C. games to end. I mean all these palace coups or whatever the hell is going on around here has to end, and we have to get down to business of governing.” Boehner last survived an attempt to oust him at the start of the new Congress, when a handful of conservatives voted against him for speaker but failed to coalesce around an alternative."

"Two Texas police officers helped a woman deliver a baby this past weekend. Their post on Facebook has gone viral. [Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) trooper Dylan Duke and Grimes County Sheriff’s Deputy Steven Siracusa helped deliver the baby boy in Navasota, Texas. Officers Duke and Siracusa were at a traffic stop when they got the call that an ambulance was being sent to a gas station because a woman was in labor there.  Trooper Duke went directly to the gas station and helped the woman and her husband. The trooper called Saint Joseph’s Hospital and staff told him how to prepare the woman to deliver the baby. Deputy Siracusa arrived on the scene a bit later and he helped Officer Duke deliver the child. A baby boy, Oscar Jr. was born and he was safely transported to Saint Joseph’s Hospital. The Texas Department of Public Safety posted about the event on its Facebook page and as of the time of publication, there have been 2. 6K Facebook responses, 431 Facebook shares, and 86 comments.  One of the comments said, “So proud of you Trooper Dylan Duke and Deputy Siracusal[.] Glad you guys were close and could help this family! A big ‘high five’ to you both!” Chaz Greene commented, “Thank you Trooper Duke and Deputy Siracusa! Another fine example of how our Peace Officers make our communities better places in which to make a living and a life!” “Imagine the cool birth story little Oscar will one day tell his friends   …     ‘I’m so special that it took 2 Texas State Troopers to deliver me!’ Awesome job Troopers.

"’  ’ ’   Jessica Lachs lived the Wall Street banker life for years,   including stints in Hong Kong and London working   for  ’ ’   Then the 2008 financial crisis struck and Lehman Brothers   collapsed.  ’ ’   Lachs left Wall Street to get an MBA, hoping that some magical   moment would strike where she would know what else to do with her   life.  ’ ’   ”I thought that I’d be sitting in a class and just have this   moment of inspiration and I’d be like ’’This is it! This is my   passion! This is what I want to do! ’’” Lachs told Business   Insider. ”That absolutely didn’t happen.” ’ ”   That moment of clarity didn’t happen in that instant, but it   would several years later when Lachs realized the   spreadsheets she’d been using as a general manager of a     startup were just the tip of the data that the   startup could be using to   its business.  ” ”   To dig deeper, Lachs taught herself how to code and learning   just one programming language to start set her on the path   to running one of the most important departments at   DoorDash, a $700 million food delivery startup that’s   challenging the likes of GrubHub and UberEats. ” ’   Lachs tends to be   so giving up her Wall Street   career on the gamble that she’’d find something she’’d love in   business school was ”really scary,” she says now looking back.   Lachs enrolled at The Wharton School at the University of   Pennsylvania and took a variety of classes trying to find   her niche in the business world. ’ ’   “It’s really easy to tell the story and say ’’Oh, I went   to business school to figure out what I wanted to do. ’’ But to   actually live through that and not know what I wanted to do and   not know where I was going to be was a pretty scary thing,” Lachs   said.  ’ ’   A basic computer science class never held her attention, but a   class in entrepreneurship started to change her perspective on   what it meant to be in business.  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”The class made me realize entrepreneurs don’t always look like   what, in my mind, they look like,” Lachs said. ”In my mind,   they’re these incredibly charismatic, white male, visionary  —     basically the opposite of me.” ’ ”   As part of her class, she started a business called  where multiple   friends or family could contribute to an expensive gift   like an iPad or expensive TV. She stuck with the business after   graduation, but before long she had to don her banker hat again   and took a hard look at her business’ numbers.  ” ’   ”While it was a nice small business, it was never going to be a   DoorDash,” Lachs said. ”That’s when I decided to do something   else.” ’ ’   It was another risk, but this time Lachs worked her way to   finding her true passion: data. ’ ’   Through the New York startup scene, she got an introduction to   Sequoia Capital, a venture firm that introduced her to Tony Xu.   The former Stanford grad had launched a food delivery   startup in Palo Alto and needed a general manager to help launch   in new cities.  ’ ’  ’ ”   Joining a tech startup as a woman didn’t give Lachs pause,   despite  towards treatment of women. Even the   most valuable private tech startup, Uber, is  into allegations of   sexual harassment in the workplace. ” ’   ”To be honest, the thought didn’t really cross my mind when   joining tech. It was just that it was going to be a lot like   banking,” Lachs said. ”The fact that I’m a woman here is sort of   a  .” ’ ’   She joined DoorDash in June 2014 when the startup only had   20 to 30 people and helped build it from there. At first, it was   a      gig, whether it was going out   to sell new restaurants or orienting new drivers (called Dashers)   to the system  —   ”even taking out the garbage every Saturday   night,” Lachs said.  ’ ”   But the more DoorDash launched new markets, more questions   would come up. Boston didn’t work the same as Palo Alto, and Los   Angeles was on a different growth trajectory than San Jose. There   were a lot of questions that the company wanted answered, but no   one in place to be that   person.  ” ’   ”Maybe I’m a    but I love having the answers to   things. And in order to get these answers, you really have to dig   into the data,” Lachs said. ”That became my role, to be the sort   of Q&A center for DoorDash.” ’ ”   Lachs’ background in banking meant she could do the job well   enough by just working on her Excel spreadsheets. But that   quickly became a limitation. DoorDash had tons of data it was   collecting on its business, from how much couriers were making on   each order to which items were the most popular on weekends, but   it was up to Lachs to start processing it.  ” ’   Determined to learn how to code, she spent two weeks  a basic programming language for working in databases   to pull and extract information. Lachs largely learned through   all of the free online classes available and leaned on her     that had experience to help her through the tricky   spots.  ’ ’   ”A   investment and you can be a beginner and pull some   basic data,” Lachs said. ”I think where people get stuck is that   basic SQL doesn’t get you very far in the real world because data   sets are never as neat and clean as the ones that are in the   tutorial. And making that jump is much trickier.” ’ ’  ’ ’   It took Lachs another month or two to learn enough that she could   solve about 80% of the questions asked of her. One of the first   challenges they tackled was learning how much a Dasher needs to   make in different markets in order to keep them working for   DoorDash and not desert to another competitor.  ’ ”   These days, Lachs team has expanded from just her to now 8 people   and she’s now  for the   company. By the end of 2017, she hopes to have doubled the number   of people on her team. ” ’   In addition to its works on the hard problems, like shaping a   market, Lachs’’ team also works on fun stuff. The company’’s   PR team loves to make crazy requests like what foods are   spiking during the presidential debates in red vs blue states, or   random trivia like how many menu items on DoorDash say ”Earth”   for Earth Day.  ’ ’   “That contributes to morale more than the bottom line, but it   just goes to show you how diverse a data role can be from some of   the   stuff to something more serious,” Lachs said. ’ ’   Just because her team has found success in building the food   delivery startup into the $700 million company it is today   doesn’’t mean Lachs has stopped trying to learn. To this day, Lach   keeps a bookmark folder on her computer called ”Learning” with   links to more courses and tutorials she wants to take. But   now, she’’s one of the leaders at DoorDash who is teaching a new   wave of employees how to analyze data beyond an Excel   spreadsheet and become empowered as a result. ’ ’   “I’m a testament to the fact that you really can teach yourself a   lot now,” Lachs said. ”There are a tonof great   resources out there if you want to learn something, between free   online resources, the videos, and just the people that you   surround yourself with  —   you can learn pretty much everything. ” ’ ’Jessica Lachs lived the Wall Street banker life. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’"
"Reputed Trump confidant and Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy told PBS News’s Judy Woodruff Monday that President Donald Trump is considering dismissing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, according to a tweet by Woodruff. [.@ChrisRuddyNMX tells me Pres Trump is ”considering perhaps terminating” Robert Mueller as special counsel @NewsHour,  —   Judy Woodruff (@JudyWoodruff) June 12, 2017,   The news comes on the eve of Attorney General Jeff Sessions testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committe on the Russia investigation. This follows a hearing featuring the testimony of fired FBI director James Comey before the same body. Mueller  —   who, on his appointment by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, took independent control of the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 elections  —   had a shadow cast on his impartiality when Comey, a   mentee of Mueller’s who suceeded him at the Bureau, revealed under oath that he deliberately leaked a potentially privileged memo to the press specifically to ensure the appointment of a special counsel. The ploy worked. Rosenstein, who was handling the investigation because Sessions had already recused himself based on his involvement in the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, came under immense political pressure to appoint a special counsel. Mueller was quickly applauded as an impartial choice by voices across the political spectrum. Since his appointment, he has made signals as to the criminal nature of his investigation, hiring Andrew Weissmann, the former head of the DOJ criminal division’s fraud section, and former Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben. A more controversial pick of Mueller’s was former prosecutor and WilmerHale partner Jeannie Rhee. In 2015, according to Politico, she performed work for the Clinton Foundation, defending it from FOIA requests related to Hillary Clinton’s private email server. These developements have raised some red flags on the right. For example, Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News, “This is going to be a witch hunt. ” Joining the chorus was Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning, suggesting Mueller’s role should be curtailed if not eliminated. In a prepared statement, he wrote: Given former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony that there is no collusion between President Trump and Russia to do with the campaign, the scope of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation should be dramatically narrowed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to simply the leaks and the Obama administration unmaskings to led to this witch hunt in the first place. If Mueller refuses to investigate these leaks, which are one of the central reasons he was even appointed as Special Counsel, then the Special Counsel should be discontinued. It is not up to the Justice Department to choose who the President of the United States is. The American people already made that decision in 2016. Sessions will testify tomorrow at 2:30 p. m. Eastern Time."
" (CNN) Here’s a look at WikiLeaks and the trial of Chelsea Manning.   Facts:WikiLeaks is an organization that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website.   It was founded in 2006 by Julian Assange, activist, computer programmer and hacker.  Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst who provided WikiLeaks with classified documents, was convicted of violating the Espionage Act in 2013 and sentenced to 35 years in prison. Her sentence was later commuted by President Barack Obama.  Timeline:December 2007   WikiLeaks posts the US Army manual for soldiers dealing with prisoners at Camp Delta, Guantanamo Bay. March 2008   WikiLeaks posts internal documents from the Church of Scientology. September 2008   WikiLeaks posts emails from the Yahoo email account of Sarah Palin.  November 2008   WikiLeaks posts a list of names and addresses of people it claims belong to the   British National Party. November 2009   WikiLeaks posts what it claims are 500, 000 messages sent during the September 11, 2001 attacks.  April 5, 2010   A classified military video is posted by WikiLeaks. It shows a US Apache helicopter firing on and killing two journalists and a number of Iraqi civilians in 2007. The military claimed that the helicopter crew believed the targets were armed insurgents, not civilians.  May 2010   The US military detains Manning for allegedly leaking US combat video, including the US helicopter gunship attack posted on WikiLeaks, and classified State Department records. Manning was turned in by Adrian Lamo, a former hacker, who Manning confided in about leaking the classified records.  July 6, 2010   The military announces it has charged Manning with violating army regulations by transferring classified information to a personal computer and adding unauthorized software to a classified computer system and of violating federal laws of governing the handling of classified information.  July 25, 2010   WikiLeaks posts more than 90, 000 classified documents relating to the Afghanistan war in what has been called the biggest leak since the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War. The documents are divided into more than 100 categories and touch on everything from the hunt for Osama bin Laden to Afghan civilian deaths resulting from US military actions.  October 22, 2010   WikiLeaks publishes nearly 400, 000 classified military documents from the Iraq War, providing a new picture of how many Iraqi civilians have been killed, the role that Iran has played in supporting Iraqi militants and many accounts of abuse by Iraq’s army and police. November 28, 2010   WikiLeaks begins publishing approximately 250, 000 leaked State Department cables dating back to 1966. The site says the documents will be released ”in stages over the next few months.” November 28, 2010   The WikiLeaks website suffers an attack designed to make it unavailable to users. A Twitter user called Jester claims responsibility for the attack.  December 1, 2010   Amazon removes WikiLeaks from its servers. April 24, 2011   Nearly 800 classified US military documents obtained by WikiLeaks reveal details about the alleged terrorist activities of al Qaeda operatives captured and housed in Guantanamo Bay. September 2, 2011   WikiLeaks releases its archive of more than 250, 000 unredacted US diplomatic cables. October 24, 2011   WikiLeaks announces that it is temporarily halting publication to ”aggressively fundraise.” Assange states that a financial blockade by Bank of America, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union has cut off 95% of WikiLeaks’ revenue. December 16, 2011   Manning’s Article 32 hearing, the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing that will determine whether enough evidence exists to merit a   begins.  February 23, 2012   Manning is formally charged with aiding the enemy, wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or records. February 26, 2012   WikiLeaks begins releasing what it says are five million emails from the private intelligence company, Stratfor, starting with a company ”glossary” that features unflattering descriptions of US government agencies. The authenticity of the documents can’t be independently confirmed.  July 5, 2012   WikiLeaks begins publishing more than 2. 4 million emails from Syrian politicians, government ministries and companies dating back to 2006. February 28, 2013   Manning pleads guilty to some of the 22 charges against him, but not the most serious charge of aiding the enemy, which carries a life sentence.  June 3, 2013   Manning’s   begins.  July 30, 2013   Manning is acquitted of aiding the enemy, but  found guilty on 20 other counts, including violations of the Espionage Act. August 21, 2013   A military judge sentences Manning to 35 years in prison. August 22, 2013   Through a statement read on NBC’s Today show, Manning announces he wants to live life as a woman and wants to be known by his new name, Chelsea Manning. April 23, 2014   A Kansas judge grants Manning’s request for a formal name change from Bradley to Chelsea.  July 22, 2016   WikiLeaks releases nearly 20, 000 emails from Democratic National Committee staffers. The emails appear to show the committee favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders during the US presidential primary. October 7, 2016   More than 2, 000 hacked emails from Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta are published by WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks claims that it has more than 50, 000 of Podesta’s emails and pledges to continue releasing batches of documents during the weeks leading up to the election.  January 3, 2017   During an interview on the Fox News Network, Assange says that Russia did not give WikiLeaks hacked emails.   January 12, 2017   WikiLeaks tweets that Assange will agree to be extradited to the US if Obama grants clemency to Manning.  January 17, 2017   Obama commutes Manning’s sentence, setting the stage for her to be released on May 17.  March 7, 2017   WikiLeaks publishes what they say are thousands of internal CIA documents, including alleged discussions of a covert hacking program and the development of spy software targeting cellphones, smart TVs and computer systems in cars. In a statement, Assange says that the website published the documents as a warning about the risk of the proliferation of ”cyber weapons.” The documents are not independently authenticated.     April 20, 2017   Authorities tell CNN that they are taking steps to seek the arrest of Assange, preparing criminal charges against the WikiLeaks founder. The investigation of Assange and WikiLeaks dates back to 2010 but prosecutors struggled with the question of whether the First Amendment protected Assange. Now, they reportedly have found a way to proceed but offered no details on the nature of the charges they plan to file.     May 3, 2017   During a Senate hearing, FBI director James Comey refers to WikiLeaks as ”intelligence porn,” declaring that the site’s disclosures are intended to damage the US rather than educate the public. ”People can argue that maybe there is conduct WikiLeaks has engaged in the past that’s closer to regular news gathering but in my view, a huge portion of WikiLeaks’ activities has nothing to do with legitimate news gathering,” Comey says.  May 17, 2017   Manning is released from prison. "
" (CNN) At a sumo training camp on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, tension was beginning to mount.  The World Sumo Championships was just days away. For the wrestlers in the Mongolian national youth team, a win would gain them global recognition. Acceptance into a Japanese ”heya” (a sumo stable) might be just around the corner.  It’s a moment that required weeks of preparation, as photographer Taylor Weidman    who shadowed the Mongolian wrestlers in the buildup to the competition    knows all too well.  ”Wrestlers here would stay in small shared rooms or in dorms with bunk beds,” Weidman said. ”They would practice sumo technique once a day and also do other cardio and strength workout. Meals were huge. They stayed at this camp preparing for over a month. ”Wrestlers would eat big meals with lots of mutton and rice. Traditionally, I think sumo wrestlers are supposed to have two huge meals a day, followed by naps so the calories aren’t burned off right away.” Sheer size is important in sumo wrestling, but it’s not necessarily a trump card: agility, speed and technique are all important as well. If the athletes are successful at the world championships, their lifestyle can become even more taxing as they look to climb through the international ranks of sumo wrestling and make their way in Japan.  ”Trainees in Japan who are accepted into a sumo stable are called ’rikishi,’ ” Weidman said. ”They wake up at around 5:30 in the morning to work out, then they cook and clean for the senior wrestlers in their stable.  ”They have a strict set of rules they have to live by    they can’t drive cars, they have to wear traditional ’yukata’ and ’geta’ whenever they go out, they have to wear their hair a certain way.” Hunger to win  Japan has traditionally dominated the sport, and it’s only in the past decade that Mongolia has emerged as such a dominant force. The past four ”yokozuna,” sumo wrestling’s highest rank, have all been from Mongolia. Although sumo isn’t an Olympic sport, Mongolian athletes have scooped medals in judo and wrestling    similar sports that have provided 17 of the nation’s 26 medals in Olympic history.  Part of the reason for Mongolia’s success in wrestling sports    sumo in particular    is because of the way they are embedded within Mongolian culture, Weidman explains.  ”Mongolia has their own version of wrestling that virtually every boy grows up practicing,” he said. ”The sport translates well and has helped Mongolia win Olympic medals in wrestling and judo. It’s very similar to sumo wrestling. ”The other reason that I’ve heard, talking to Japanese fans, is that Mongolians are simply hungrier to win in sumo. In Japan, sumo wrestlers, even champions, aren’t particularly rich by national standards.  ”In Mongolia, though, the same salaries seem much bigger. Sumo champions are also incredibly famous in Mongolia, and former champions have parlayed their sumo careers into careers in politics and business.”"
"What? Congress has until midnight Friday to come up with a plan to fund the government through early December, or once again, it will be lights out for many operations. The problem this time: Passing a plan all seemed quite simple, since Democrats and Republicans gave up several policy items they wanted attached to the overall spending bill. But the measure still omits $220 million that Democrats wanted to help Flint, Mich. and other cities manage emergencies, and they are threatening to block the bill when it comes to the Senate floor on Tuesday. Who to watch: Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader from Nevada, who may broker a final deal. Keep an eye on Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and a longstanding and fierce advocate for Flint who rarely gives up a legislative fight easily."
" (CNN) A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded.    The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14, 000 miles (22, 500 kilometers) according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the   study. Varvara, which is Russian for ”Barbara,” left her primary feeding ground off Russia’s Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara’s journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere   round trip between the ”warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder   waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions.”   Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim.   During her   journey, Varvara visited ”three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,” which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University.   ”For her to go to Mexico,” Mate said, ”It’s pretty strong evidence that it’s where she’s from.”  Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to ”navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,” he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower.   ”Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look,” Mate said.

"Congressional legislation titled “Blue Lives Matter,” which would make cop killing a “hate crime,” will move to a floor vote in September, despite having no Democrat support. [With    gunfire deaths of police up 94 percent 16 Republican sponsors will bring the Blue Lives Matter Act, to debate and a floor vote when the U. S. House and Senate return from their summer recess.  There have been 66 police officers and 24 police K9s who have died in the line of duty in 2016, according to the “Officer Down Memorial” web site. That is actually 3 percent better than total deaths by this time last year. Although automobile accidents and automobile assaults have historically been the largest contributor police officer fatalities, the recent ambush assassinations of police officers in a number of states has almost doubled the number of deaths associated with gunfire this year. The Louisiana legislature recently passed a “Blue Lives Matter” law at the state level, and Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards, whose family includes four generations of police officers, signed it in May to add up to five years to prison sentences for “targeting” police. The covered classes include police, firefighters and emergency medical responders, on a list of “hate crime” criteria including race, age, gender, religion, color, creed, disability, sexual orientation, national origin, or ancestry. The Louisiana debate pitted police unions and other safety unions, which usually lean Democrat, against an array of civil rights groups that claimed police have not faced the historic discrimination that hate crime designation was supposed to address. But the movement for a national “Blue Lives Matter Act” has accelerated after television coverage of the horrific targeting of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Kyle Huwa, a spokesman for the federal bill’s author, Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck, told Reuters, “Since the Baton Rouge tragedy, we’ve received calls and messages from around the country from individuals asking about the ‘Blue Lives Matter Act’ and we’re confident more members of Congress will be   the legislation as soon as they can when Congress reconvenes. ” The “Blue Lives Matter” movement is a reaction to the “Black Lives Matter” movement, which arose in the wake of allegations of police udeliberately sing lethal force against black men. President Obama, Vice President Biden and Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with six leaders of ‘The Fraternal Order of Police Executives’ on July 11, following the assassination of five police officers in Dallas by a man allegedly inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement the week before. The President compared the Dallas deaths to “horrible shootings not too long ago in Charleston at the church where Dylann Roof killed a number of black people. ” Obama claimed that there was no need for Blue Lives Matter legislation, because the Dallas shooter, were he still alive, “most certainly would” be prosecuted by the federal government for a hate crime and subject to harsher penalties. When pressed by the Fraternal Order members regarding the Blue Lives Matter legislation, Obama was noncommittal. Allison   regional director for the   division of the   League (ADL) told the   Mother Jones magazine that adding police officers to the hate crime list “distorts the purpose of the original legislation. ” The ADL claims that the law should protect people who are victimized because of immutable characteristics, something that someone cannot change about themselves or should not have to change about themselves. ADL opposes Blue Live Matter legislation because “occupation is temporary and an inherently different kind of attribute. ”"
" (CNN) A little before midnight on Monday, March 20, James Harris Jackson, a white Army veteran from Maryland, set upon a stranger on a New York City street and stabbed him to death.  By early Wednesday, Jackson walked into a police station and confessed. He did not know the victim,    Timothy Caughman. He only knew that Caughman was black. That was enough.  In a jailhouse interview with the New York Daily News, Jackson expressed one note of regret.  ”I didn’t know (Caughman) was elderly,” he said, explaining that his preferred victim would have been ”a young thug” or ”a successful older black man with blondes.” On Monday, a week after the attack, a grand jury brought an indictment. Two of the four counts against Jackson included an unusual designation    murder, but qualified as ”an act of terrorism.” ”James Jackson wanted to kill black men, planned to kill black men and then did kill a black man,” said Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, adding that he did it in New York, a diverse city, to send a message. At the White House on the same day, a reporter questioned press secretary Sean Spicer about Caughman’s murder and, specifically, Jackson’s subsequent statements.  ”So, what do you say to this?” American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan said. ”This is clear    it’s racism at its ugliest.” Spicer offered a blanket condemnation of ”hate crimes, other crimes,   crimes,” but never commented specifically on the attack in Manhattan, saying: ”I don’t know all the details.”  President Donald Trump’s Twitter feed remains silent on the matter. In the days after the murder, Trump tweeted about ”National Agriculture Day,” NASA and the GOP health care bill. After Jackson turned himself in, Trump sent out two messages about an attack in London that left four dead, including the alleged assailant.  ”A great American, Kurt Cochran, was killed in the London terror attack,” Trump tweeted. ”My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends.” But nothing about Manhattan. Caughman has been absent from the presidential social media feed. Jackson, too. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. A natural question follows. What separates the London attack from the one in New York? In both cases, individuals allegedly driven by hateful ideologies had committed deadly acts in their respective services    and done so in locations that would focus media attention.  ”The deadly attack on Timothy Caughman was domestic, racist terrorism,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted on Tuesday. ”Why is the White House afraid to call it a hate crime?” Whatever Trump says    or doesn’t say    about Caughman’s killing, the broader reaction across the political spectrum and in the media can be reduced to a similar point: ”terrorism” in the    American vernacular has become shorthand for ”Islamic terrorism.” Think of the 2010 Austin terror attack. Doesn’t ring a bell? You’re probably not alone.  When Andrew Joseph Stack III, a white Texan, flew a small airplane into the Internal Revenue Service office building in Austin seven years ago, killing himself and one person inside, authorities were careful not to describe the act as ”terrorism.” ”Part of our jobs in law enforcement is not to overreact and cause undue panic,” Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said. ”And with the information that we had, there was no need to alarm our colleagues around the country and community members by using the word ’terrorism.’ That is why definitely I did not use it yesterday and I’m not using it today.”  But Stack’s own words, from his apparent suicide manifesto, were plain. He railed at length against the tax code, citing its finer points as ”the measure of a totalitarian regime.”  The letter continued: ”I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard,   government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are.” Stack had plotted to use deadly, spectacular violence in an effort to trigger a political reaction    in the service of political aims. It fit the federal definition of ”domestic terrorism” to the letter. But even then, during the first Obama administration, officials were loath to use the term. During an interview on The Diane Rehm Show weeks later, former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano sought to carve out a distinction. ”To our belief, (Stack) was a lone wolf,” she said. ”He used a terrorist tactic, but an individual who uses a terrorist tactic doesn’t necessarily mean they are part of an organized group attempting an attack on the United States.”  Napolitano’s description mapped out, if tortuously, a clear difference. But it also reinvented the word. By her given logic, a single individual without material support from others could not    by definition    carry out a terror attack.  The rise of ISIS further complicated the matter. Based in Iraq and Syria, the group is often referred to as having ”inspired” an attack. In the chaotic hours after, analysts and experts search for certain ”hallmarks” to denote the ISIS influence. The perpetrators, in these cases, are not members of the group, nor lone wolves    they are something in between. An unwelcome nuance in charged times. The full facts surrounding Jackson’s alleged murder of Caughman have not yet fully emerged. But if Jackson’s confession withstands the legal process, and especially if the charges as currently constructed are proven, today’s questions will linger on much longer."
" (CNN) There are some moments in life I will never misremember: The joy of seeing my newborn son for the first time. The sweet excitement of my first kiss. Or, the terror I felt on September 11, 2001, as I wandered the streets of New York with my    son, trying to protect him from the horror all around us as we and millions of others walked for miles to safety. Joy and pain, those memories are locked in my mind, and barring any onset of dementia, the details of those experiences will never fade. Most of us are wired this way, and that is why much of America, including myself, is having a hard time understanding how NBC news anchor Brian Williams could possibly have ”misremembered” whether he was actually aboard a Chinook helicopter forced down by rocket fire during the Iraq invasion in 2003. Especially when there were multiple witnesses around to remind him of the truth of what happened that day.  Instead, Williams inserted himself into the story. He made himself the hero and for that he should be held accountable. Since that day in Iraq, Williams has retold the dramatic story of how he survived the terrifying experience, while reporting on the war. It was a classic tale of the unselfish, intrepid newsman, risking his life to bring America a   glimpse at the horrors of war. But after finally being called out earlier this week by the real heroes of that day who risked their lives, Williams now has a different recollection: He was not on that plane, but on another one that landed later. ”I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago,” Williams said this week. ”I want to apologize . .. I would not have chosen to make this mistake. I don’t know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.”  Brian Williams memes: Remembering the good ol’ days that never were, Williams’ admission, 12 years later, came after crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment’s Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire told Stars and Stripes that the NBC anchor was ”nowhere near that aircraft or the two other Chinooks flying in the formation that took fire.” According to soldiers at the scene, Williams arrived in the area about an hour later on another helicopter after the three helicopters in front of him landed. And they’ve been wondering for years why the news anchor got it so wrong. ”It was something personal for us that was kind of   for me. I know how lucky I was to survive it,” Lance Reynolds, who was the flight engineer, reportedly told Stars and Stripes. ”It felt like a personal experience that someone else wanted to participate in and didn’t deserve to participate in.” In addition to his public apology, Williams owes a private apology to the soldiers who flew on that mission and an apology to every man and woman who fought bravely and died to protect our American freedoms, often without glory. Those are the people who make it possible for a guy like Williams, a college dropout, to realize the American dream of rising to the top in their career and entering the privileged class. But often times it’s too easy to forget to give others credit, especially when we get overly impressed with our individual accomplishments    or as it seems in Williams’ case, when we value the glory over the story we are trusted to report. Opinion: Cut Brian Williams a break on Iraq claim, We live in a competitive,   culture where few of us are immune to the power of television to turn even the most obscure among us into overnight superstars. Once the cameras come on, it’s tempting for us to get caught up in our own hype, to value celebrity over substance, and to start talking about ourselves as a ”brand.” And sadly, journalists are no exception. Providing stories (or content, as we now call the news) is a   business. And to stay in business, we need people to watch, read,   and share our content. Brian Williams does this better than most and that’s why he has been called ”America’s Most Trusted Newsman.” Mónica Guzmán,   journalist and vice chairperson of the Society of Professional Journalists’ Ethics Committee, says what Williams did was absolutely wrong and that he should be held personally accountable by both his audiences and his employer, NBC.  ”We are in a moment of outrage. One of the primary journalism tenets is to tell the truth. Trust is our only currency and when you lose trust there’s not much left,” she told me. How Brian Williams’ Iraq story changed, Williams has broken that principle and Guzmán believes society suffers when that happens. ”We know the difference between when the WWF wrestler says, ’I’m going to kill you. ..’ and what Brian Williams says on a newscast. We have an expectation of accuracy and it needs to be credible. If we don’t have sources of information that we can trust, we cannot be an informed society.” Will his apology be enough? Or, is coming clean 12 years later too little too late for Williams?  Only time will tell. But the backlash to his apology has begun. Several soldiers on the plane that day are not satisfied with Williams’ apology and say he’s still exaggerating the facts and his role in the story.  Either way, it’s a sad day for journalism and the public. I’m hoping NBC will send a strong message, a suspension without pay or even dismissal, if it turns out Williams has done unrepairable damage. When journalists believe that misremembering is a legitimate excuse for misleading the public    it’s time to get a new job. Read CNNOpinion’s new Flipboard magazine.

"Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” conservative commentator Mark Steyn offered his views on how President Donald Trump should proceed with the Paris Accord on   climate change.    Brian Kilmeade asked why the issue of climate change had become a “religion” for the left, to which Steyn noted those on the left argue border enforcement is an impossibility, yet they believe they can control the heavens. “I think precisely because it is so meaningless,” Steyn replied as to why the left is so invested in the issue. “Because if you say to them, ‘Let’s enforce the border’  —   ‘What? Are you out of your mind? That’s just a natural phenomenon. We can’t enforce the border. People are going to be coming in anyway.’ But if you say to them, ‘We can control the very heavens,’ that, we can do. And it’s actually literally insane. The less it has to do with your life, the more the left is invested in it. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
"Nigel Farage said he must make a “rational judgement” as to how he can “best help the Brexit process” when deciding whether he will stand in the upcoming general election. [“I came into politics because I believe in the Brexit cause passionately,” the former leader of UKIP told Breitbart News Daily. He said he has to make a decision about whether he can best serve that cause “sitting in the House of Commons on the back benches” or “staying as the leader of a group in the European Parliament, able to do battle up close with EU. ”  “Clearly one would have visibility in the House of Commons but equally, the negotiations take place in Brussels over the next two years and the European Parliament has the right of veto at the end of the   process” he told hosts, Breitbart News Editor in Chief Alexander Marlow and Breitbart London Editor in Chief Raheem Kassam.  On the topic of why Theresa May decided to hold a snap election, Farage said the Prime Minister is taking advantage of very favourable polling and looking to secure a mandate. But he also reminded listeners the Tories stand accused of breaking election spending rules in 2015. He said: “I’m guessing that what pushed her was that in the 2015 General Election the Conservative Party pretty willfully broke spending rules in lots and lots of constituencies and they were facing, potentially, a whole series of prosecutions. Up to twenty MPs are facing reruns in their seats. ” The former UKIP leader also warned that while May is “selling herself as the ‘Great Brexit PM’ the Conservative leader could use the snap election as an “opportunity to soften the impact of Brexit”. Outlining how a “soft Brexit” would look, Farage said: “We’ve technically left, because we’re no longer part of the treaty, but we have a relationship a bit like Norway where we’re part of the European Single Market. We still have to obey all the regulations that are made and passed in Brussels and Strasbourg, there’s still a degree to which European courts have jurisdiction over our citizens, we’re probably still paying a contribution, or a membership fee of some kind, and freedom of movement would remain with a transition period of three or five years. “We’d have voted to leave, but we’d be half out half in,” he said, summarising the situation. Asked by Marlow what he thought of May having “ripped off the best parts of UKIP’s platform” Farage said: “I think it’s a victory because both myself and UKIP have completely changed the whole landscape of British politics. “But does [the Prime Minister] actually mean it or was she just saying it for   electoral advantage?” he added. On the topic of the upcoming French presidential election, the iconic MEP said he believes Le Pen has a “genuine chance” against Emmanuel Macron, noting the “globalist, centrist” candidate, who has yet to hold any elected position, “has never been tested in battle”. For the benefit of U. S. listeners, Farage was also asked to outline some of the differences between UKIP and the National Front. He said: Traditionally the Front National came with deep roots in Vichy France   —   very   very chauvinistic and not particularly attractive to most of the outside world. To be fair to Marine Le Pen she’s come in as leader, she’s moderated it, she’s made it more sensible, she’s made people far less [scared] of it. And to be fair, her own position is now a sceptical, mainstream, moderate Eurosceptic position that is being held by more and more parties across Europe.  "
" (CNN) Tennis great Serena Williams and Reddit   Alexis Ohanian are engaged.  A spokesperson for Ohanian confirmed that he popped the question while the two were vacationing in Rome. Williams first announced the news herself in a Reddit post on its ” ” forum.  ”I came   little   had a bag packed for   a carriage awaited” Williams said in her Reddit post, which was written like a poem and had a cartoon of the couple at the top.  ”Destination:   escort me to my very own ’charming’  to where our stars first   now it was full   the same table we first met by   time he made it not by   by   on one   said 4    .” Ohanian also announced the engagement on his Facebook page, linking to Williams’ Reddit post and adding, ”She said yes.” Williams and Ohanian, who have been dating since the fall of 2015, have mostly kept their romance out of the spotlight, though she does post pictures of them on her Instagram account from time to time.

"Seattle (CNN) Two years ago, Seattle Police Officer Jim Ritter realized his city had a major problem. People weren’t reporting hate crimes. Watch ”New Day” and ”CNN Newsroom” each Friday to see inspiring stories of officers going above and beyond the call of duty. He’d hear about them, anecdotally. Some were horrifying incidents. But they weren’t showing up on police reports. ”After determining most of these crimes were being committed in the commercial districts throughout the city, (I) had to sit down and figure out what are we going to do about this,” Ritter said. He started a program called Safe Place. It’s a     initiative that designates local businesses as a place where victims of hate crimes can shelter while waiting for the police to arrive. It’s a simple concept based on something he remembered from his childhood    houses with stickers that signaled to kids walking to school that if something bad happened, they could knock on the door and get help. Ritter designed a sticker    a police shield with the LGBT rainbow symbolism. It goes on the front of any business agreeing to call police if a victim of a hate crime comes inside looking for help. ”In this day of communications, everybody just assumes someone else is calling police and we can’t afford to have that happen anymore, neither can these victims,” Ritter said. Ritter, who is gay, admitted that he never knew so much   crime was going unreported in his own city, where he’d worked as a cop for nearly four decades. ’We don’t want to screw this up’ Now, Safe Place has become so popular, he can barely think about anything else. Police departments across the country are calling, asking for help implementing his program in Cincinnati, Louisville, Birmingham, Durham, Baltimore, Honolulu, Columbus    and even in Canada in Vancouver, British Columbia. Most notably, the Orlando police launched Safe Place on the   anniversary of the Pulse Night Club massacre. ”I actually feel like I’m making a positive difference in society and not just going through the motions,” Ritter said. ”I think the majority of police chiefs and administrators that contacted me said, ” Hey, Jim, we want to get this right, we don’t want to screw this up.” He’s even working with the Department of Justice. ”You’ve got victims from all different kinds of minority communities that have the same thing happen to them. They are assaulted or victimized either because of who they are or who these suspects portray them to be.” Here in Seattle, Ritter said two felony assault cases were reported from inside a Safe Place business within the program’s first week. ”One of those safe place locations, the witnesses were holding a suspect down when police arrived,” he said. And police immediately noticed an increase in the reporting of hate crimes. ”And that told me that it was starting to work as designed,” he said. A recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Center says that hate groups are on the rise, and crimes against members of the LGBT community are up from last year. ’You better watch your back’ Aaron Amundsen is one of the victims targeted right after the election in November. He’s a Seattle tattoo parlor owner, and he walked out to his car one day to find a wet, wrinkled up note. ”I opened it up and thought: Is this a joke? And then it hit me, and I got really upset by it,” he said. ”It was: ’Hey blank, we won so you better watch your back.’ Just a bunch of political and anti LGBTQ slurs. And it was kind of threatening and really spooky.” The note said, ”Your days are numbered. Make America straight again to make it great again. You will see.” It included two gay slurs. ’Standing up for what’s right’ Amundsen didn’t report the incident right away. But his business partner posted it to Facebook, where it got a lot of attention. Ritter noticed it and encouraged Amundsen to file a police report. He did, and says he’s glad that he filed it, even if no one is ever caught. ”It’s about standing up for what’s right,” Amundsen said. But Ritter said he’s having to have fewer and fewer conversations like that one    encouraging reluctant victims to report hate crimes. And that’s, in part, thanks to the awareness that Safe Place brought to Seattle. ”I’ve always known that the majority of the community is for the most part fundamentally fair and they want to do the right thing,” Ritter said. ”I think the Safe Place initiative has caused the conversation to start where they can verbally acknowledge that, and feel comfortable about talking about topics which they really haven’t had the opportunity to talk about in the past.”"
"SEATTLE  —   Ever since last summer, when Lynn Gemmell’s dog, Bela, was inducted into the trial of a drug that has been shown to significantly lengthen the lives of laboratory mice, she has been the object of intense scrutiny among dog park regulars. To those who insist that Bela, 8, has turned back into a puppy  —   “Look how fast she’s getting that ball!”  —   Ms. Gemmell has tried to turn a deaf ear. Bela, a Border   shepherd mix, may have been given a placebo, for one thing. The drug, rapamycin, which improved heart health and appeared to delay the onset of some diseases in older mice, may not work the same magic in dogs, for another. There is also a chance it could do more harm than good. “This is just to look for side effects, in dogs,” Ms. Gemmell told Bela’s many  . Technically that is true. But the trial also represents a new frontier in testing a proposition for improving human health: Rather than only seeking treatments for the individual maladies that come with age, we might do better to target the biology that underlies aging itself. While the diseases that now kill most people in developed nations  —   heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, cancer  —   have different immediate causes, age is the major risk factor for all of them. That means that even treatment breakthroughs in these areas, no matter how vital to individuals, would yield on average four or five more years of life, epidemiologists say, and some of them likely shadowed by illness. A drug that slows aging, the logic goes, might instead serve to delay the onset of several major diseases at once. A handful of drugs tested by federally funded laboratories in recent years appear to extend the healthy lives of mice, with rapamycin and its derivatives, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for organ transplant patients and to treat some types of cancer, so far proving the most effective. In a 2014 study by the drug company Novartis, the drug appeared to bolster the immune system in older patients. And the early results in aging dogs suggest that rapamycin is helping them, too, said Matt Kaeberlein, a biology of aging researcher at the University of Washington who is running the study with a colleague, Daniel Promislow. But scientists who champion the study of aging’s basic biology  —   they call it “geroscience”  —   say their field has received short shrift from the biomedical establishment. And it was not lost on the University of Washington researchers that exposing dog lovers to the idea that aging could be delayed might generate popular support in addition to new data. “Many of us in the biology of aging field feel like it is underfunded relative to the potential impact on human health this could have,” said Dr. Kaeberlein, who helped pay for the study with funds he received from the university for turning down a competing job offer. “If the average pet owner sees there’s a way to significantly delay aging in their pet, maybe it will begin to impact policy decisions. ” The idea that resources might be better spent trying to delay aging rather than to cure diseases flies in the face of most   philanthropy and the Obama administration’s proposal to spend $1 billion on a “cancer moonshot. ” And many scientists say it is still too unproven to merit more investment. The National Institutes of Health has long been organized around particular diseases, including the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. There is the National Institute on Aging, but about a third of its budget last year was directed exclusively to research on Alzheimer’s disease, and its Division of Aging Biology represents a tiny fraction of the N. I. H. ’s $30 billion annual budget. That is, in part, because the field is in its infancy, said the N. I. H. director, Dr. Francis Collins. “I would resist the idea that we should shift funds away from cancer and diabetes and Alzheimer’s, where there are clear drug targets, and say, ‘We’re going to work on this hypothesis,’ ” Dr. Collins said. “If you had a lot of money for geroscience right now, it’s not clear what you would do with it that would be scientifically credible. ” Researchers in the field, in turn, say they might have more to show for themselves if they could better explain to Congress and the public why basic research on aging could be useful. “People understand ‘my relative died of a heart attack, so I’m going to give money to that,’ ” said Dr. James L. Kirkland, a Mayo Clinic researcher. “It’s harder to grasp ‘my relative was older, that predisposes them to have a heart attack, so I should give money to research on aging.’ ” Some companies have embraced the quest for drugs that delay aging. Google created Calico (for California Life Company) in 2013 with the goal of defeating aging. A   called Unity has said it will develop drugs based on new research on aging mice suggesting that purging certain cells can extend a healthy life span. And a group of academic researchers is trying to persuade the F. D. A. to recognize aging as a disease for which a drug can be marketed, which they hope will draw more interest from pharmaceutical firms. The agency recently greenlighted its proposed trial of a widely used diabetes drug, metformin, to see if it can delay the onset of other   diseases in older adults who have received a diagnosis of at least one, as one study suggests it might. But the group has yet to secure funding. One reason, the researchers say, is that the notion that aging is immutable is so deeply entrenched. “When I go out and try to raise money for this, the first thing people will say to me is, ‘Eh, we’re all getting older,’ ” said Steven Austad, a researcher at the University of Alabama. Most of us harbor the intuition that we age because our bodies, like our cars, our furniture, our patience, just wear out. But the best argument that life span is not   biologists say, has long been evident: Living things age at significantly different rates. “The squirrels in my neighborhood have a   life span, but they look like rats that live two years,” said Gary Ruvkun, a pioneer in aging biology at Harvard Medical School. “If you look at what nature has selected for and allowed, it suggests that you might be able to get your hands on the various levers that change things. ”  That aspiration gained traction in the 1990s and 2000s, when scientists, armed with new tools of molecular biology, homed in on the complex cellular pathways that regulate life span in many species. By removing genes that produced certain proteins, or adding genes that produced others, researchers found they could significantly extend the lives of simple laboratory organisms like budding yeast, roundworms and flies. “It’s not just wearing out, it’s a program,” Dr. Ruvkun said. “The genetics told us that. If you can modulate it with a few simple perturbations, that’s the definition of a program. ” Since genes cannot be so easily manipulated in humans, it was significant in 2006 when Dr. Kaeberlein and others demonstrated that rapamycin, the drug now being tested in dogs, suppressed one of the crucial proteins in yeast, resulting in a longer life span without removing a gene. The protein is known to be involved in cell growth. But just how its suppression works to extend life is still unclear, raising questions about potential unknown downsides. And it has not helped the field’s reputation that what emerged as a   hope for fighting aging, amplifying proteins called sirtuins, has not yet panned out. Initially believed to be activated by resveratrol, a substance found in red wine, sirtuins provided a seemingly excellent excuse to imbibe. But the pharmaceutical giant GSK, which had purchased a company for $720 million with the intention of developing a   drug, cut back its efforts in 2013 after the results of the original genetic experiments came under question. A year later, one of only two major foundations funding longevity research stopped making new grants in the field. Besides the standard scientific road bumps, biology of aging researchers say their field’s reputation suffers from its association with   peddlers selling   creams, hormones and fountains of youth, not to mention the likes of Dorian Gray, Voldemort and assorted Sith lords. Efforts to prolong life are often viewed as selfish or trivial. “It seems pretty egocentric while we still have malaria and TB for rich people to fund things so they can live longer,” Bill Gates, whose philanthropy focuses on global poverty, said during a session on Reddit last year in response to a question about Calico, the Google spinoff. Coleen Murphy, a molecular biologist at Princeton who is studying reproductive age in women, said she had received hate mail accusing her of trying to overpopulate the earth. Critics of research on extending life span also worry that, rather than increasing   health span, which researchers say is their goal, geroscience will consign humanity to living longer in a compromised state. That is happening, with or without longevity research, thanks to advances in public health that have allowed life spans to increase.   of older Americans have multiple chronic conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and in just over a decade, a fifth of Europeans and Americans will be 65 or older. “If you go to a dinner party and you tell people you’re working on longevity, they say, ‘Oh that’s terrible,’ ” Dr. Murphy said. “I think if they just understood it’s a way to slow the whole process, instead of fighting it one disease at a time, they’d understand why we’re interested in this. ” Dogs age faster than humans, and bigger dogs age faster than smaller dogs. The 40 dogs that participated in the rapamycin trial, which just concluded its pilot run in Seattle, had to be at least 6 years old and weigh at least 40 pounds. Like Lynn Gemmell’s Bela, whose cholesterol was high, many of them were showing signs of aging: loose skin, graying muzzles, a stiffness in the joints. So were some of their owners. “How are you going to be sure people are going to be giving this to their dog rather than taking it themselves?” Ms. Gemmell, 58, joked with Dr. Kaeberlein on her first visit to the veterinary clinic, where Bela was given a checkup and an echocardiogram to measure heart function, a marker that could conceivably register an improvement over the 10 weeks that she would be given the drug. A research coordinator for human clinical trials at a hospital, Ms. Gemmell adopted Bela as a    rescue without realizing how much outdoor time she would need with her. Now divorced with two grown daughters, Ms. Gemmell dons a headlamp when she returns home in the dark, and takes Bela out with a     ball and a collar light. “I wish she could live forever,” she said. Over 1, 500 dog owners applied to participate in the trial of rapamycin, which has its roots in a series of studies in mice, the first of which was published in 2009. Made by a type of soil bacterium, rapamycin has extended the life spans of yeast, flies and worms by about 25 percent. But in what proved a fortuitous accident, the researchers who set out to test it in mice had trouble formulating it for easy consumption. As a result, the mice were 20 months old  —   the equivalent of about 60 human years  —   when the trial began. That the   mice survived about 12 percent longer than the control groups was the first indication that the drug could be given later in life and still be effective. Dr. Kaeberlein said he had since achieved similar benefits by giving    mice the drug for only three months. (The National Institute on Aging rejected his request for funding to further test that treatment.) Younger mice, given higher doses, have lived about 25 percent longer than those not given the drug, and mice of varying ages and genetic backgrounds have been slower to develop some cancers, kidney disease, obesity and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. In one study, their hearts functioned better for longer. “If you do the extrapolation for people, we’re probably talking a couple of decades, with the expectation that those years are going to be spent in relatively good health,” Dr. Kaeberlein said. Still, drugs that work in mice often fail in humans. It is also hard to ask rodents about their quality of life. The side effects, depending on the dose and duration, include mouth sores, cataracts, insulin resistance and, for males, problems with testicular function. No one knows if people, who already live a lot longer than mice, would see a proportional increase in life span. And some researchers say there would be serious concerns in testing rapamycin, or any drug, in healthy people just to slow aging. What if a drug lengthened life for some and shortened it for others? Could anyone ethically put a healthy person into a test that might actually shorten life span? “It’s not as simple as cancer, where patients are going to die anyway if they don’t get the drug,” said Andrew Dillin, a biology of aging researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who recently raised the questions in Nature, a scientific journal. Ethical concerns aside, such a trial would take decades. But what dog lovers have long considered the sad fact that their pets age about seven times as fast as they do, Dr. Kaeberlein knew, would be a boon for a study of rapamycin that would have implications for both species. An owner of two dogs himself, he was determined to scrounge up the money for the pilot phase of what he and Dr. Promislow called the Dog Aging Project. Last month, he reported at a scientific meeting that no significant side effects had been observed in the dogs, even at the highest of three doses. And compared with the hearts of dogs in the control group, the hearts of those taking the drug pumped blood more efficiently at the end. The researchers would like to enroll 450 dogs for a more comprehensive   study, but do not yet have the money. Even if the study provided positive results on all fronts, a human trial would carry risks. Dr. Kaeberlein, for one, said they would be worth it. “I would argue we should be willing to tolerate some level of risk if the payoff is 20 to 30 percent increase in healthy longevity,” he said. “If we don’t do anything, we know what the outcome is going to be. You’re going to get sick, and you’re going to die. ” For her part, Ms. Gemmell is not counting on anything. The other night, when she got home from work, she was ready to read her mail and have a glass of wine. But Bela greeted her as usual, ball in her mouth, ready to play. For now, she said, this is how they both plan to stay young."
"Erik Prince, managing director of the Frontier Resource Group, and a former Navy SEAL who helped found the famous Blackwater security contracting firm, appeared on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM to talk about the slaughter of Christians in the Middle East, Africa and, increasingly, in Europe. [“Radical Islam is on the march in many places around the world,” Prince warned. “Whether you start in East Africa, in Somalia, Somalia spilling over into Kenya, total chaos in Central  African Republic, the eastern DRC  …     Nigeria, of course, has a terrible problem with Boko Haram, that literally means ‘Western education is prohibited,’ anything Western, including Christianity.  Of course Libya, terrible failed state.  Egypt, the entire Levant, everything from Lebanon to Syria.  Iraq, of course, the ongoing Christian persecution  —   genocide  —   occurring there. ”  He compared the situation in the Middle East to the Thirty Years War of European history, which had “religious overtones, Catholic versus Protestant, political overtones  …     and you have that now in the Middle East between Sunni and Shia Islam, radical Islam from both of those sects hates Christianity, hates Judaism, hates any other organized religion, and attacks it without limit. ” Without adequate legal protection in much of the Middle East, Prince said Christian communities are being crushed between the “plate tectonics” of the   civil war.  He noted that most secular leaders in the Middle East are preoccupied with “staying in power and keeping their borders intact,” so “the last thing on their minds are Christians. ” Prince warned those besieged Christians not to expect much help from the nominally Christian nations of the Western world, particularly under the current U. S. Administration. “Europe, as you see, can’t deal with radical Islam.  It is really still not even embracing the reality of the threats they face, and so they’re backing up, not going forward,” he said.  “So Christians are very much left to themselves, and truly, it’s not just Christians.  Of course, they’re going to suffer the most, because no one’s really helping them, other than a few Christian groups in the United States. ” SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon noted these ancient Christian communities in the Middle East had survived some of history’s most destructive forces storming through the region, but “it seems like they might not survive” radical Islam.  He asked Prince if this outcome was foreseen when military operations were launched against Islamist forces after  . “Clearly it wasn’t,” Prince replied, “and I don’t believe it was going to have the   and   effects that it has, or the enduring chaos.  Tipping over secular strongmen created a vacuum that’s been filled by the hardest of   of religious zealotry, which seeks to exterminate any other belief system that it encounters.  It is the absolute of absolutism.  And so, whereas before you might have other political forces or military forces that rolled through, and they let religions sit where they were, in this case it is such absolute religious fascism that it’s exterminating anything it touches. ” Another factor in the current wave of Middle Eastern violence, according to Prince, was the doubling of the “  male” population from about 15 million to 30 million, between 1995 and 2010.  He noted that previous wars of attrition have not stopped until “the losing side lost at least 30 percent of its   male population,” causing them to reach “the point of exhaustion. ”  Militant Islam is nowhere near this point of exhaustion today. “They say there is a ‘ ’ in Syria right now.  Malarkey,” scoffed Prince.  “That is gonna burn on, and fester on  —   Sunni, Shia, super   radical Daesh  —   that will continue burning until it burns itself out. ” He said the next U. S. Administration would be   to “let Christians help Christians, and I mean really help them  …     and that means going    with them, and helping to defend their homelands.  This is not a matter of sending blankets and clean water.  They need physical security. ” Prince thought the current political structure of the Middle East was unlikely to survive the earthquake caused by those grinding “tectonic plates” of Islamic war. “It’s time to pretty much redraw the map of the Middle East,” he said.  “I don’t see Syria and Iraq ever going back together exactly the way it was written up by the   treaty at the end of World War I: an arbitrary line drawn on a map to suit the needs of French and British colonial empire.  So let there be a Christian homeland, or let there be a Christian region that’s part of a greater Kurdistan, or something.  But give Christians a place to go, give them the means to defend themselves, and give them the means, again, to build a civil society. ” Prince suggested that relying on protection from governments like the   regime in Egypt, which has made promises to Egyptian Christians and apologized for their persecution at the hands of Islamist forces like the Muslim Brotherhood, might be a mistake, as that regime is under attack from the Brotherhood, ISIS,    …     and the U. S. State Department. Prospects for the future are also uncertain in   Africa, where Christianity has been vibrant in recent years, but is under assault from Islamist dictatorships, and terrorist groups such as   in Somalia, which has launched bloody operations across the border into neighboring Kenya. “It is direct, selective Christian slaughter,” Prince said of attacks such as  ’s raid on a Nigerian university in Garissa, which killed 147 people.  Unfortunately, outrage in the Western world against the slaughter of Christians is never sustained, so the same failed U. N. peacekeeping strategies grind on, year after year, creating a refugee crisis that is exporting Islamist pathologies to the West. “Instead of putting out the fires where people live, so people can live in their homelands, we let these fires burn  —   call it the    the United States, the Europeans, all the people with the big   militaries  —   don’t ever put the fire out, and that’s what’s causing all these refugee crises, and causing Christians living in those areas to be slaughtered,” said Prince. He said radical Islam is “not out to win an intellectual debate, or a debate of faith.  It is: you believe what I believe, or I’m going to cut your head off.  It’s that absolute. ” “These psychopaths take explosives into an airport, and they think they’re serving their God and their cause by blowing up people for their alleged crime of riding the subway or getting on a commercial airplane,” Prince said of the Brussels bombings.  “That’s the kind of insanity we’re dealing with, and there’s really no other way, when dealing with insanity, than to put a rabid dog down. ” The same could be said of Boko Haram in Nigeria, which Prince noted is trying to create its own “caliphate” ruled by Islamic law, patterned after the terror state created by their partners in ISIS.  He compared their tactics of pillaging and looting to earlier historical menaces, such as the Huns and Mongols  …     combined with the enslavement and indoctrination tactics of the Islamic State, which have enabled Boko Haram to transform captive women and girls into brainwashed suicide bombers.  Prince used them as another example of his thesis that Islamist radicalism thrives because major powers refuse to strike fatal blows against them. “Again, the Nigerian government lacks the means, or the intensity, or capability to actually go into Sambisa Forest and clean it out, and to deny them sanctuary.  And so they’re able to spread their terror into Cameroon, to the east, and to Niger to the north.  They’ve been beaten back somewhat, but they’re still, in terms of total death count, they are the worst terrorist organization in the world,” he said. Unfortunately, Prince warned that Islamists do understand the importance of striking fatal blows against Christianity, and other faith traditions in their path.  This explains why, as Bannon observed, hardy Christian communities that survived the militantly atheist totalitarian horrors of the 20th Century are threatened with extinction by radical Islam in the 21st. “I certainly believe Christianity will survive globally,” said Prince  …     but he quoted Scripture in noting that “the gates of hell are blowing hot right now” against Christian communities in the Middle East. “It will make for a very, very few, but a very faithful few, who remain,” he predicted, and said it was incumbent on Western governments, as well as charitable private citizens, to defend those faithful few, lest they be driven out from their ancestral homes in a final purge. With chemical and nuclear weapons coming into play, Prince warned that “this could spiral big and ugly, more quickly than we can imagine. ”  Breitbart News Saturday is broadcast on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 10AM to 1PM EST. You can listen to the full interview with Erik Prince below: "
"’  ’ ”   China’s economy led its European counterpart by leaps and bounds   at the start of the Renaissance. ” ’   China was so far ahead, in fact, that economic historian Eric L.   Jones once  that the Chinese empire ”came within a hair’’s breadth   of industrializing in the fourteenth century.” ’ ”   At the start of the 15th century, China already had the compass,   movable type print, and excellent naval capacity. In fact,   Chinese Adm. Zheng He commanded  to   Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa from   about 1405 to 1433  —   about a century before the Portuguese      India. He also had ships  the   length of Christopher Columbus’ Santa Maria, the largest of   Columbus’ three ships that crossed the Atlantic. ” ”   Still, it’s hard to understand the magnitude of the shift China’s   economic fortunes have seen just with historical anecdotes. And   so, in a recent note to clients, Macquarie Research’s Viktor   Shvets included two fascinating charts, which we included below,   showing the changes China saw over the past 800 years. ” ”   The first chart shows the estimated share of a given country’s   economy as a part of the overall world economy. ” ”   In the 15th and 16th centuries, China accounted for 25% to 30% of   the global economy, but by the 1950s and ’60s, after the   destruction of World War II and under the rule of Mao Zedong, it   fell below 5%. Today its economy makes up about 17% of the global   economy  —   roughly the same share as the US. ” ’  ’ ’   The second chart compares    per capita in   China, Japan, and the US to the British GDP per capita measured   in 1990 . In this case, the British GDP per capita in each   year is 100, so if a number from China, Japan, or the US is above   100, then its GDP per capita is greater than in Britain, and if   the number falls below 100, per capita output is lower than that   in Britain. ’ ’   As Shvets writes, on a per capita basis, China was the wealthiest   part of the world from 1200 to the 1300s  —   aside from Italy. Even   as late as the 1600s it was roughly on par with the Brits. After   that, however, the GDP per capita relative to Britain declined   all the way up to the 1970s, when it was below 10% of the British   standard of living. In about 1990, it starts to pick up again,   but it has yet to recover to levels seen from 1200 to 1600. ’ ”   Interestingly, Japan also followed a downward trajectory from   1200 to the 1950s  —   when its GDP per capita was about 28% of the   UK’s following its defeat in World War II. But unlike in China,   GDP per capita in Japan bounced back quickly, and its GDP per   capita from 1970 to today is roughly comparable to Britain’s. ” ’  ’ ”   One other thing that stands out is that while the size of China’s   economy today rivals the US’s, its GDP per capita is still much   lower. At the same time, while Japan’s share of the global   economy is significantly smaller than those of both the US and   China, its GDP per capita is roughly on par with the UK’s  —   and   far greater than China’s. ” ’   Putting the two charts together, Shvets added that ”most of the   relative and absolute decline occurred from the 18th century   onwards, coinciding with the accelerating pace of industrial   revolutions, which ushered the modern age of much faster   productivity growth rates.” ’"
"In a long piece at ESPN, Jayson Stark criticized Major League Baseball for avoiding the pitfalls besetting the NFL and the NBA as players dive into liberal political causes and insisted that baseball should be used as a platform to drive social politics. [Stark begins his article noting that some baseball clubs warn players that if they start talking politics, they should mentally prepare for a backlash from at least half their fans no matter what political stance they take.  “The platform of the baseball player is a very powerful one,” Yankees general manager Brian Cashman says in a video shown to players. “It’s a free country, and you can always utilize that platform whenever you so choose. But just know, when you choose to do so, what the potential ramifications are. ” Cashman also cautions players that if they choose to jump into the world of politics, swimming in that pool means “no lifeguard” and they will likely swim against the tide. The New York Yankees aren’t the only team to remind players that using baseball for politics could be problematic. But, those warnings fall flat for ESPN’s Stark. “Is 2017 the time for a new code of conduct?” Stark writes. “Is it time for a more socially aware culture  —   in this, the sport of Jackie Robinson?” Clearly Stark thinks the era of Trump is worse  —   or at least as bad  —   as the days when African Americans did not have equal rights. Stark next brings MSNBC reporter Chuck Todd into his piece. Todd, evidently a big baseball fan, has written on the topic of politics in baseball. But, even Stark had to report Todd’s conclusion that baseball is about “escape” instead of a political battlefield. Todd also notes that baseball didn’t “heal anything. ” “That’s why I look at baseball as more of an ‘escape’ than a ‘heal’   …     unless some players stand up and decide to heal,” he said. Stark, though, is quite unhappy that baseball is the one major sport that leaves politics at the ballpark’s doors. He seems to want baseball to wallow in the same controversies visited upon the NBA and the NFL as players continue to speak out on liberal politics. But has the extreme politics of the NBA and the NFL been a boon to their respective sport? The NFL, for instance, has lost fans and seen TV ratings crash since quarterback Colin Kaepernick began his   protests by refusing to stand for the national anthem. In fact, it has become so bad that the drop off in ratings and the loss of advertising money has been called “the Kaepernick effect. ” The saturation of politics in sports has also affected sports organizations outside the big professional leagues. ESPN, for instance, has been losing up to 10, 000 subscribers a day as the cable network continues its drive toward   politics. Customers of the sports cable network grew so upset and vocal about the liberal politics infused with its sports coverage that the network’s ombudsman felt it necessary to investigate the complaint. The result did nothing to assuage customer’s worries. For his part, though, ESPN’s Jayson Stark seems utterly oblivious to these problems as he urges Major League Baseball to put its game on the back burner in order to jump into the arena of politics to attack Donald J. Trump. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."
"Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton has an 8 point lead over Donald Trump among likely voters in November, according to a new poll out Monday.  Clinton leads by 7 points among registered voters more broadly, according to the new poll from Monmouth University.  The presumptive Democratic nominee leads her GOP counterpart 49% to 41% among likely voters and 47% to 41% among registered voters.  2016 election center: Road to 270, She also has a commanding lead of 27 points among women and a more than    advantage among minority voters, while Trump leads by 13 points among men and by 11 points among white voters.  Like other recent polling, the Monmouth poll found a solid pocket of support for   candidates. Clinton’s lead shrinks slightly when pollsters included libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who pulled down a combined 13 percentage points.   Also consistent with other polling, both candidates have negative favorability ratings, though Trump is further underwater. The mogul also has more voters who say it is very important to keep him out of the White House (49%) than Clinton, (41%).  Monmouth surveyed 803 registered voters from June 15 to 19 for the poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3. 5 percentage points."
" (CNN) A new winter storm slammed the East Coast on Saturday, putting Washington, D. C. and Baltimore into the deep freeze. In Washington,   inches of snow and sleet were expected to accumulate by Sunday morning, the National Weather Service reported. In Baltimore, the prediction was even worse, with   inches expected. The storm snarled roads, forcing the closure of   southbound in Baltimore and leaving so many disabled vehicles that emergency vehicles couldn’t get through, CNN affiliate WBFF reported. A sheet of ice covered part of Madison Avenue NW in Washington because a water main broke on Friday, CNN affiliate WJLA reported, trapping about half a dozen cars. ”I can’t even move the car,” A. J. Kumar told WJLA. ”It’s right up to the bumper.” People are having to stay put all over the East Coast. At 9:30 p. m. ET Saturday, at least 1, 546 fights had been canceled in the United States, many in the Washington and Baltimore areas, according to FlightAware. com.  The weather agency calls for accumulations of   inches in New York City,   inches in Philadelphia and   inches in Boston by Sunday morning. Up to 12 inches were forecast for West Virginia, CNN meteorologists said. In Tennessee, 50, 000 customers in 12 counties have lost power, many in the Cumberland Plateau area in the eastern part of the state, said the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. The governor elevated the state to a higher level state of emergency, meaning citizens may be eligible for state and federal assistance. So far, no more fatalities have been reported. The state said on Friday that 18 people had died from   causes. In Kentucky, a   Walmart in South Williamson was evacuated and closed indefinitely after store employees detected cracks in the walls, apparently caused by the heavy snow load on the roof, Walmart spokeswoman Tricia Moriarty said.  The department store will stay closed until the building is fully inspected and determined to be fully safe, Moriarty said.  Roofs also collapsed in Harlan and Jackson, but no injuries were reported. To make matters worse, a brand new arctic blast is pushing cold air into the lower 48 states, creating dangerously low temps Sunday in the Northern Plains, CNN meteorologists said. Wind chills may reach minus 30 or minus 40 degrees,  Monday and Tuesday are shaping up to be very cold days in the East and Midwest.  The National Weather predicted Monday high temperatures of 22 in Philadelphia, 17 in New York City, 10 in Chicago, 4 in Cleveland and 25 in Washington. A storm was heading toward the Rocky Mountains, too, creating a chance of snow from Montana down through Colorado and into northeastern New Mexico, CNN meteorologists said. In Denver,   inches of snow could fall."
"TEL AVIV  —   Donald Trump’s   loss to Sen. Ted Cruz in the Iowa Caucus on Monday was welcomed by Palestinians across the board, including members of terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip who spoke to Breitbart Jerusalem. [Gazans expressed mild relief at Trump’s Iowa setback, though as one resident said, given Gaza’s dismal condition “the U. S. presidential elections are the least of our concerns. ”  A number of young Palestinians told Breitbart Jerusalem that all of the candidates are indifferent to the Palestinians’ “hardships,” and there is virtually no difference between them. Hani Elshaeer, a Gaza journalist, said that few Palestinians are hopeful that the U. S. elections will make any difference in their lives. “All of the candidates, from both parties, are on the same page on the Arab and Muslim issues, and share a hostility towards the Palestinians and their cause. ” “Donald Trump said out loud what others think about Arabs and Muslims, that’s why people were happy that he lost (in the Iowa Caucus) but the differences between them are minuscule,” he said. Maha Shahin, a political science student at Nablus’ Al Najah University, told Breitbart Jerusalem, “Trump positioned himself as the enemy of the Muslims and the Arabs, that’s why everybody wanted to see him lose. ” “The elections will have no impact on the Palestinian issue, because the Americans focus on crises in the Arab world and on the emergence of radical groups,” she said. Hamas official Husam Badran told Breitbart Jerusalem that the movement is unfazed by Trump’s performance in Iowa: “There is no difference between the candidates, therefore we don’t really care who wins or loses. ” “America’s overwhelmingly   attitude puts it at odds with the Palestinian people,” he said. “We are a resistance movement, and as such we never trusted the American government’s policies and plans. We are not party to the great passion with which some Arab groups follow the campaign. ” Abu Ayna   a   Salafi militant leader allied with Islamic State ideology, told Breitbart Jerusalem “the candidates are all the same. They are infidels and we should fight them as such. ” He said he was not particularly happy at Trump’s misfortune, but said “undoubtedly, the brothers in IS can’t wait to chop his head off because of what he said about Islam and Muslims. ” “The candidates are all enemies of Islam and it’s the duty of Muslims to put up a fight the same way they labor to curtail the advancement of Islam and IS,” he said. “Allah promised that they would be defeated, and it’s our role to make sure it happens. ” Trump came in second place in Iowa despite the latest polls giving him a nearly five point lead over Cruz and the other GOP candidates. In December, Trump angered the larger Muslim world when he called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on. ” Speaking on ABC’s Good Morning America in the wake of his remarks, Trump clarified that under his proposal American Muslims can come and go as they please. “If a person is a Muslim, goes overseas, and comes back, they can come back. They’re a citizen. That’s different,” Trump explained. “But we have to figure things out. ” Trump expressed his hopes that a shutdown “will go quickly,” as soon as “our leaders figure out what the hell is going on. ” Speaking on CNN following his “shutdown” proposal in December, Trump further warned that the country risks more terrorist attacks if his plan for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration is not implemented. “You’re going to have many more World Trade Centers if you don’t solve it  —   many, many more, and probably beyond the World Trade Center,” Trump told CNN’s Chris Cuomo. Trump speculated that there are already terrorists inside the country. “They want our buildings to come down they want our cities to be crushed.   …     They are living within our country. And many of them want to come from outside our country. ”"

"Breitbart News Senior Editor MILO joked that J. K.

This is a plot from a poorly written novel, it’s probably in Harry Potter somewhere since that is the only book that millennial liberals can reference. ” MILO continued to claim that “Again, like their other theories, that is insane. American voters had multiple options to express their displeasure with the system. ” “They might vote for third party candidates like Crazy Jill Stein and high as a kite Gary Johnson. Maybe even the heroic Jeb Bush,” he joked. “Or they could just stay home.  And guess what, Democrats did all three to varying degrees in different states. The Democrat push to get Republicans to vote third party failed disastrously at the same time. That McMuffin guy wouldn’t even win his home state of Utah. ” Written from prepared remarks.

"’’ ”If you haven’t been paying careful attention, you might have missed that Tesla has been eclipsed by Uber as the most interesting company in the world.” ”Don’t get me wrong: Tesla is still very, very interesting.” ’But Uber has captured the startup Zeitgeist in the same way that Tesla did a decade ago and ridden that wave to a $60   valuation, while Tesla has to content itself with a mere $30 billion market cap.’ ’Electric cars are just so 2010. In 2016,   is the New New Thing, and everyone in the transportation business is trying to figure out if Uber can combine   with the New New Things  —     cars  —   and establish a   paradigm shift.’ ”This is why Uber’s debut of an experimental   fleet of cars in Pittsburgh was such a big deal. If Uber can scale that idea, it would have the potential to monopolize on how billions of people worldwide get from point A to point B for next hundred years. Travis Kalanick’s startup would rapidly advance beyond being just a tech’  taxi service.” ’There would suddenly be far fewer justifications for owning a vehicle.’ ’Tesla CEO Elon Musk formerly was not all that hot on the whole   concept for two reasons.’ ”First, it didn’t make intellectual sense to him  —   he saw people sharing their living spaces through Airbnb, but like a lot of people in the car business, he didn’t think that widespread   was going to displace the conventional ownership model.” ”Second, Tesla is deeply invested in the ownership model. It needs customers to be willing to go into debt to finance its expensive electric vehicles. Even a cheaper   EV such as the Model 3 will require a car loan or some type of lease  —   customers simply aren’t going to have $35, 000 in cash lying around.” ’’ ”But Musk is nothing if not adaptable, and he knows that Tesla’s decade of mindshare dominance could be coming to an end. Tesla has 500, 000 vehicles to build in 2018, and Musk understands that it’s not possible to shift away from the premise that Tesla would produce EVs and then sell them  —   the business model wouldn’t tolerate it.” ”I think he’s probably been losing a bit of sleep over Uber’s ascent and its recent, rather stunning   rollout. So he and his team have had to come up with a way to diversify Tesla into some sort of    business to avoid being steamrolled.” ”In this context it’s worth noting that Uber is unencumbered by Tesla’s commitment to EVs  —   Uber vehicles could be powered by anything. So Kalanick has flexibility where Musk doesn’t.” ”The solution for Tesla is economic, and it’s called the Tesla Network.” ”After Tesla reported   earnings and its first profit in three years this week, Musk was asked during the company’s earnings call about the Network, which is what the company will likely call a   network for owners.” ’ between Musk and Dougherty analyst Charlie Anderson (emphasis added):’ ’That last bit has been, I think, erroneously characterized as fighting words  —   a verbal salvo fired from the cannons of that stout old battleship the USS Elon Musk across the pirate bow of the upstart privateer Travis Kalanick.’ ’’ ”That’s a misinterpretation of Musk’s thinking, if you ask me.” ’What Musk was really getting at was the lost value that almost all car owners endure because their vehicles sit idle most of the time. If you buy a $100, 000 Tesla Model S, you make payments on the car but might use it for only an hour or two per day. All it does it lose you money.’ ’The Tesla Network would enable you to use Tesla’’s forthcoming advanced Autopilot features to permit someone else to ”rent” your car while you’’re aren’’t driving it. An unproductive  —   and depreciating  —   asset could become a productive one.’ ”You would have to deal with additional wear and tear, not to mention the sanitary habits of borrowers  —   and, of course, a lot of people who spend a hundred grand on a   luxury car are going to have no interest in letting someone borrow it. But you’d be a leg up on how Uber wants you to operate, without even an idle asset to monetize.” ’’ ’That’’s what I believe Musk meant by his ”the people versus Uber” comment. (I reached out to Tesla for clarification, but it’’s busy right now, so I’’ll update this post if and when I hear back.) The people are Tesla customers who could own a car that they could use on the Tesla Network  —   Tesla would make them economic players in a way that using Uber wouldn’’t.’ ”It’s obvious that Musk has been grappling with a way to change his mind on       as the market shifts around him. The Tesla Network sounds like a reasonable way to get in on the new action without ruining Tesla’s bread and butter, now and for the future: selling cars, and lots of them.” ”Because the solution is a compromise, I would hesitate to label it brilliant. But as our most recent Nobel laureate in literature once put it, the times, they are  ’.” ’And Musk is no enemy of change.’"
"Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford shot down a recent news report alleging that   Security Adviser Michael Flynn delayed a military campaign to retake the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa. [McClatchy reported this week that 10 days before President Trump took office,   Security Adviser Susan Rice explained to Flynn the plan to retake Raqqa  —   which included arming Syrian Kurdish fighters, the most effective fighting force on the ground, but whom Turkey considers terrorists.  Flynn told Rice to hold off, “a move that would delay the military operation for months”  —   according to a timeline prepared by the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( ). The report suggested that Flynn did so to benefit Turkey, for whom he had been paid to lobby. But Dunford, who was appointed to the position in 2015 by President Obama, said that Flynn’s decision did not cause any delay in the assault on Raqqa, which has not yet begun: REPORTER: I’d like to ask the  —   the two veterans of the Obama administration if the decision at the end of the Obama administration to hold off on arming the [Kurds] and let the Trump administration make that decision, did that have any effect or delaying the assault on Raqqah? DUNFORD: Yeah, David, I  —   I can  —   I can answer that question directly. It did not. One of the  —   one of the preconditions for seizing Raqqah was the isolation of Raqqa, which included  —   just recently completed a very difficult fight in an area called Tabqa. And I think you’re familiar with that, where the Syrian Democratic Forces actually had 100 killed in that battle alone. So, we are just at about the point where the seizure of Raqqah would’ve taken place in a normal course of events. So, it has not delayed the seizure of Raqqah. The reporter then asked why an offensive on Raqqa was getting underway now, versus  . Mattis then chimed in: MATTIS: Only now are we completing the encirclement of Raqqah and there’s been no delay in the effort to do that other than the normal vagaries of the battlefield where we have to deal with an enemy who’s trying to defeat us. Trump would eventually decide to arm the Syrian Kurdish fighters. Dunford and Brett McGurk, the administration’s envoy to the   State coalition who also briefed the press alongside Mattis, said they have worked to mitigate Turkish concerns. “We can’t do this without Turkey. We work with them every single day. We have some differences, as we do with every coalition partner, but they’re very close allies and we consult with them all the time,” McGurk said."
"International disputes over territory can be ugly affairs, waged with all the nastiness of a divorce, backed with the force of armies. Just in the last few years, China has built  islands topped with military bases to back its claim to vast stretches of ocean, in conflict with half a dozen other Asian countries, while Russia has forged a path of bloodshed and destruction in Ukraine over its annexation of Crimea. But that’s not how Canada and Denmark roll. Their way of contesting ownership of an uninhabited island in the Arctic would better suit a dinner party than a battlefield: It comes down to B. Y. O. B. Hans Island is really just a large rock, but it happens to lie smack dab in the middle of the Nares Strait, a    channel of very cold water separating Canada and Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. The island falls within the   territorial limit of either shore, allowing both sides to claim it under international law. Canada and Denmark set out to establish a definitive border through the strait in 1973, but they couldn’t agree on what to do about Hans Island, so they left the issue aside to be resolved later. The calm diplomatic waters grew choppy in 1984 when Canadian troops visited the island, planted their nation’s flag and left another symbolic marker as well: a bottle of Canadian whisky. The Danes couldn’t let that stand. The country’s minister of Greenland affairs soon arrived on the island to replace the offending Canadian symbols with a Danish flag and a bottle of Danish schnapps, along with a note saying “Welcome to the Danish island. ” And so began a spirited dispute, one that has lasted decades, with each side dropping by the island periodically to scoop up the other side’s patriotic bottle and replace it with their own. (What becomes of the evicted liquor? No one is  —   hic  —   saying.) Canada and Denmark agreed in 2005 on a process to resolve the status of Hans Island, but the diplomats have made little headway since then. Hoping to encourage the negotiations, two academics put forward a proposal in 2015 to blend realpolitik with real estate: Make the island a “condominium” of shared sovereignty under two flags  —   and presumably, two bottles."
"Yesterday, Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos was permanently suspended from Twitter for apparently harassing Leslie Jones, one of the leading actresses in the new Ghostbusters reboot. [However, whilst the narrative currently being spun across many mainstream media outlets is that Jones is an innocent victim of racist online trolls, more evidence has arisen that suggests that Jones is in fact an aggressor who deliberately orders her followers to attack her “critics” on Twitter.  Ironically, directing a targeted harassment campaign and ordering followers to attack another user is a violation of Twitter’s terms of service, and exactly what Yiannopoulos was accused of by Jones. This was what Twitter eventually used as an excuse to ban Milo, even though there was no evidence whatsoever that Yiannopoulos ordered his followers to attack the actress. No major news organisation has yet picked up on Jones’ racist tweets about white people, or the fact that she was hitting back at “trolls” before Yiannopoulos ever got involved. Appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers back in May, Meyers noted that Jones made the decision to “engage with critics” on the social media platform. ” Jones responded by triumphantly declaring that she is “not no robot [sic] that sits behind a Twitter thing and tweets out, I’m a real person. I’ve got a Twitter account and yes if you call me a name I’m going to call you a name back. ” In a not so subtle boast, Jones continued, saying that she didn’t “care how famous I am or how popular I am  —   if you call me a gorilla I’m going to call your mama one too. ” More importantly, the Ghostbusters actress pointed out that she would “blow [anyone] up” who tweeted at her that she didn’t agree with, retweeting it “so all of my followers can see it and get on your punk  …    ” Jones then trailed off before finishing her sentence.

" (CNN) Malaysia’s Transport Ministry said Thursday that more plane parts have washed up on the same remote French island as a wing part that is believed    with varying degrees of certainty    to be from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The new items found on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean include pieces of windows, seat cushions and aluminum, Malaysian officials said. But they added that it’s unclear whether the objects, which still need to be verified by French authorities, are from MH370. ”The team told us they have managed to collect more debris on the island and we have handed it over to the authorities in France,” Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told reporters. ”A plane window and some aluminum foil . .. there are many items.” French officials on Reunion and in Paris, however, haven’t reported any new plane debris.  And an Australian agency helping coordinate the search for the missing airliner said Wednesday, the day before Malaysia announced the discovery of new items, that there was no indication so far of any more aircraft debris.  ”A great deal of additional material has been handed over to the police” on Reunion, Australia’s Joint Agency Coordination Centre said in a statement. ”While this is being examined, so far none of it appears to have come from an aircraft.” The Australians are in charge of the underwater search for Flight 370 in the eastern Indian Ocean, thousands of miles from  Reunion. Malaysia has overall responsibility for the investigation into the loss of the plane. Although Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that the wing part found last week, which is called a flaperon, is certainly from MH370,  other officials have expressed more caution and say that more testing is needed. Less than an hour after the Prime Minister’s statement, Paris Deputy Prosecutor Serge Mackowiak used slightly less definitive language. He said that there were ”very strong presumptions” that the debris from Reunion is from MH370, but that absolute certainty was not yet possible. Malaysian officials provided more details later Thursday of what makes them sure it was from the missing jet, including a serial number that matches technical records. The Boeing 777, carrying 239 people, disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing on March 8, 2014.  The families, Some families of those on board have said they are angry, frustrated and bewildered by what they’ve been told. ”I was left somewhat confused and, frankly, a little angry and dismayed,” said K. S. Narendran, whose wife was one of the passengers. ”I didn’t hear facts. I didn’t hear the basics. I heard nothing,” he said, ”and so it leaves me wondering whether there is a foregone conclusion and everyone is racing for the finish.” The families of Chinese passengers, the most numerous nationality on the flight, were also unsatisfied. ”I don’t believe this. I don’t!” said Xu Jinghong, whose mother was on board Flight 370. ”I am furious and I think this announcement is very irresponsible.” Chinese families said last week they wanted ”confirmation of 100% certainty” from authorities that the part was from MH370. But the differing Malaysian and French statements appeared to leave them with room for uncertainty. Other relatives said that the flaperon was only a small piece of a much larger puzzle. ”It’s not the end,” Jacquita Gonzales, wife of crew member Patrick Gomes, told reporters. ”Although they found something, you know, it’s not the end. They still need to find the whole plane and our spouses as well. We still want them back.”  Lim Khim Fatt’s husband was on the flight.  ”There’s a lot of questions that haven’t been answered yet,” she said.  A history of family skepticism, Some families have long been skeptical and disappointed by how Malaysian officials have handled looking for and delivering news about the missing plane. The Malaysian government has been wrong several times before. On March 17, for example, Malaysian authorities publicly confirmed the final words from the cockpit as ”All right, good night.” The innocuous bit of radio banter became yet another headache for investigators when, after days of prodding from reporters and family members, they released a transcript showing the final words were actually, ”Good night Malaysian three seven zero.” Malaysian military radar captured signatures of what was believed to have been Flight 370, but it wasn’t immediately noticed. While the radar data was the key reason for expanding the search west of Malaysia, it took officials until March 11    three days after the disappearance    to explain why they were looking so far off the plane’s expected course. All the while, search efforts continued in places where data showed it could not have been    the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea. A report issued a month after the plane’s disappearance also highlighted snafus in crucial communication between air traffic control centers and Malaysia Airlines on the morning Flight 370 disappeared. The investigation, Najib, the Malaysian Prime Minister, didn’t go into any detail in his statement early Thursday on what Malaysian officials believe provides the conclusive link between the flaperon found on Reunion and MH370.  But Malaysia’s Transport Ministry provided more information later in the day, saying that a serial number on the wing part matches Malaysia Airlines’ technical records. The ministry said it found matches for a maintenance seal and paintwork on the flaperon. Mackowiak, the Paris deputy prosecutor, had stopped short of announcing a definitive link. Boeing officials have concluded that the part’s technical features    such as its color and the structure of its joints    confirm that it’s from a 777 aircraft, he said.  Drawing on documentation provided by Malaysia Airlines, experts also identified ”common technical characteristics” between the flaperon found on Reunion and that of Flight 370, Mackowiak said. His more cautious language highlights the complex, multinational nature of the investigation into what happened to MH370. Malaysia Airlines said in a statement that the confirmation announced by Najib, which it described as ”a major breakthrough,” had been made jointly by French, Malaysian, Chinese and Australian officials. But a source close to the investigation told CNN that French and U. S. experts examining the flaperon have not yet found anything that would definitively link it to Flight 370. The American officials involved are from the National Transportation Safety Board. While it is expected that the wing part will eventually be matched to MH370, the source said that there was so far nothing precise enough for 100% confirmation. The next steps, The analysis of the flaperon will continue at a specialized lab near Toulouse, France.  ”The experts are carrying out their work promptly in order to provide complete and reliable information as soon as possible to the victims’ families,” Mackowiak said. But he cautioned that he was unable to specify when the results of the ongoing analysis would be announced. ”On a forensic investigation, which is what’s going on in France, you don’t use the process of elimination and say, well, it must be a flap,” said David Soucie, a CNN aviation analyst. ”You have to have forensic proof, which is the samples from the paint, from the metal, to tie it specifically to the aircraft. That’s what they’re waiting for, and that’s what they mean by 100% conclusive.” Experts have said that investigators may be able to glean clues from the wing debris about Flight 370’s final moments before it is believed to have gone down in the southern Indian Ocean. Did it break apart in midair or hit the water intact? But neither the French nor the Malaysians made any reference to that aspect of the analysis. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Thursday that the Reunion Island discovery ”suggests that for the first time we might be a little bit closer to solving this baffling mystery.” The remnants of a suitcase that were found near the flaperon on Reunion are being sent to a different French lab for examination, Mackowiak said. Three things that could help tie the part to the plane, The search, While a Malaysian official described apparently new plane debris that was found, a journalist on Reunion Island said, citing police, that no debris was reported or handed in Thursday. Police also say that nothing definitive has been turned in during the past week. Additional air and water resources will be deployed off the coast of the island to look for debris, the French Defense Ministry announced late Thursday. A plane could be flying over the area as early as Friday morning. French paramilitary operations will also be conducted, including foot patrols, helicopter and naval search missions, authorities said. The statement made no mention of any new plane parts being discovered. It’s anyone’s guess whether many items from MH370 are likely to find their way to the remote island or others in the region. ”The problem is the only way for parts of the plane to get to Reunion Island is to continue to float,” said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst. ”The flaperon could because there are spaces inside that part that could allow air to be trapped and for it to float.” But a lot of other potentially buoyant objects    such as tennis shoes, bits of luggage and items from the plane’s galley    are likely to have become waterlogged and sunk after long months out in the ocean, she said. The bigger, heavier parts of the aircraft are likely to have gone down into the depths more quickly.  Finding the plane’s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, as well as the cockpit itself, is likely to be investigators’ best hope of unlocking the mystery of why the plane flew dramatically off course and lost communication with air traffic control. Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, said authorities have high confidence in the current search area. ”If the aircraft is in that area, which is highly probable, then we will find it,” he said.

"Students at Hampshire College were upset Friday when school officials decided to raise the American Flag once again to   after students demanded it be placed at   because of the election of Donald J. Trump. [Students at the Amherst, Massachusetts college had initially lowered the flag to   in protest against the results of the November 8 election. Days after that move a group of students later pulled the flag down and burned it.  The controversy at the college continued when on Veteran’s Day college officials raised a new flag to memorialize the armed forces, but students again launched into protest. Eventually Hampshire College President Jonathan Lash pulled the flag down entirely and opened a “dialog” on how the flag controversy was affecting the school. The decision to fully remove the flag led to a November 27   against the    . S. statement being fostered by the school. Hundreds of veterans of America’s armed forces gathered outside the school to protest the   stance the school was taking. “There’s other ways that he [Lash] could have dealt with this,” VFW Post Commander Victor A. Nunez Ortiz said at the Nov. 27  . “[Removing] our flag is disrespectful not just to the men and women who have served, but to all Americans who believe our flag is a symbol of freedom. ” President Lash, though, disputed the claim that his school was speaking against the country or our veterans. “We did not lower the flag to make a political statement. Nor did we intend to cause offense to veterans, military families, or others for whom the flag represents service and sacrifice,” Lash said. “We acted solely to facilitate   dialogue on our campus about how to dismantle the bigotry that is prevalent in our society. ” Upon raising the new flag, Lash insisted the move was a “symbol of that freedom, and in hopes for justice and fairness for all. ” Some Hampshire students claimed that the flag represented an evil nation and that the removal of the flag after the election was a “reaction to the toxic tone of the   election. ” The most recent comments by President Lash stand in contrast to his earlier claims when he excused the actions of students saying the flag represented “a powerful symbol of fear they’ve felt all their lives because they grew up in marginalized communities, never feeling safe. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."
